(KOS) FACILITY BEGAN ITS CONSTRUCTION IN JULY 2001 IN INGLESIDE, TEXAS. BASED ON INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE, WASTE MINIMIZATION, DISPOSAL, AND RECYCLING PRACTICES WERE IDENTIFIED AND IMPLEMENTED FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE FACILITY. IT IS THE GOAL OF KOS TO REDUCE THE GENERATION OF ALL CLASS I AND HAZARDOUS WASTES OR, AT A MINIMUM FOR THOSE WASTES THAT MUST BE GENERATED, HAVE THEM RECYCLED WHERE FEASIBLE. THESE CHEMICALS, FOR THE MOST PART, BECOME PART OF THE MANUFACTURED ARTICLE, BUT ARE NOT CONSIDERED EXEMPT FOR REPORTING PURPOSES. WHEN AVAILABLE, KOS ATTEMPTS TO EDUCATE THE CLIENT IN NON-WASTE GENERATING MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND CONSTITUENTS AS ALTERNATIVES TO THE INITIAL PRODUCT SPECIFICATION.  KOS WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS USED IN ITS PRIMARY ACTIVITIES TO ALLOW THE CLIENT AND KOS TO REDUCE ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THE VOLUME RELEASE OR USE OF TRI REPORTABLE CHEMICALS AND/OR THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AT THE KOS FACILITY WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE INDUSTRY DEMAND AND NECESSARY PRODUCTION, WHICH FLUCTUATES ANNUALLY. THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MEASURE OR PROJECT SPECIFIC REDUCTIONS. AS DESCRIBED EARLIER, THE GENERATION OF ALL CLASS I AND HAZARDOUS WASTES OR, AT A MINIMUM FOR THOSE WASTES THAT MUST BE GENERATED, HAVE THEM RECYCLED WHERE FEASIBLE.
