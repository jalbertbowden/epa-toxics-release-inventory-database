BMC HOLDINGS, INC. (BMC), A SUBSIDIARY OF TERRA INDUSTRIES, INC. (TERRA), OWNED AND OPERATED A CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN BEAUMONT, TX FROM 1992 TO 2008.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009 TERRA SOLD BMC TO EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY (EASTMAN).  IN DECEMBER 2009 EASTMAN ISSUED A NEWS RELEASE OF THEIR DECISION TO TERMINATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AT THE BEAUMONT FACILITY.  IN APRIL 2011, EASTMAN SOLD THE BEAUMONT FACILITY TO PANDORA METHANOL LLC (PANDORA), WHICH AT THAT TIME PANDORA WAS OWNED BY JANUS METHANOL (JANUS) AND OCI.  IN NOVEMBER 2011, OCI ACQUIRED 100% OWNERSHIP OF THE BMC ASSETS.  BMC AND TERRA UNDERSTAND THAT THE BEAUMONT FACILITY IS IN THE PROCESS OF A NAME CHANGE TO OCI NORTH AMERICA.  WHEN EASTMAN PURCHASED BMC FROM TERRA, A SERVICE AGREEMENT/CONTRACT WAS SIGNED TO LEASE CERTAIN OF THE TERMINAL ASSETS BACK TO TERRA/BMC FOR CONTINUING OPERATION AS A METHANOL TERMINAL.  THIS AGREEMENT/CONTRACT CONTINUED IN EFFECT WHEN PANDORA PURCHASED THE BEAUMONT FACILITY FROM EASTMAN.

AFTER INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT THIS CONTAMINANT WAS BROUGHT IN ON THE OIL OF A JOB LOT AND DECREASED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DEGREASER BY STICKING TO THE WATER JACKET AND REDUCING THE DEGREASER CAPACITY TO CONDENSE WATER.  THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE ACIDITY OF THE DEGREASER AND A DECREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY.  A FULL CLEANOUT WAS PERFORMED AND WASTE TRICHLOROETHYLENE WAS SHIPPED OFFSITE.  THIS IS SHOWN IN THE INCREASE OF WASTE VOLUME FROM 2010 LEVELS.  NO VIOLATION OF THE CURRENT TITLE V PERMIT OCCURRED, HOWEVER THIS DECREASED EFFICIENCY CAUSED THE EMISSIONS FROM THIS CHEMICAL TO APPROACH THE MAXIMUM PERMIT LEVELS.  AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF CLEANING THIS EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO INSURE THAT THIS EQUIPMENT IS RUNNING AT DESIGN EFFICIENCY.	NO	CCEDARLEAF@CHEMPROCESSING.COM			NO

WE DO NOT NORMALLY OPERATE OUR EXTRACTION PLANTS SIMULTANEOUSLY OR ON AN ALTERNATING BACK AND FORTH PRODUCTION SCHEDULE.  DOING THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF PRODUCTION ALONG WITH THE STARTING-UP AND SHUTTING-DOWN OR SIMULTANEOUSLY RUNNING THE EXTRACTORS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL INCREASE OF FUGITIVE EMISSIONS.    IN ADDITION, TO THE INCREASED PRODUCTION AND THE ALTERNATING PRODUCTION SCHEDULE; THE BATCH PLANT CARBON BEDS BECAME SATURATED AND HAD TO BE CHANGED WITH FRESH CARBON; IT WAS ALSO DISCOVERED AT THAT TIME THAT TWO OF THE CARBON SYSTEM VALVES WERE NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY.

(2) ALSO, DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2011, A REMEDIATION PROJECT WAS IMPLEMENTED AT THE FIRING RANGE WHICH GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LEAD WASTE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE LEAD RELEASE QUANTITIES AT PANTEX.  THE OUTDOOR PORTION OF THE FIRING RANGE AT THE PANTEX PLANT IS USED BY SECURITY PERSONNEL FOR FIREARMS PRACTICE AND TRAINING.  THE FIRING RANGE HAS SEVERAL EARTHEN BERMS THAT BULLETS ARE FIRED INTO DURING TRAINING EXERCISES.  THESE BERMS ARE COVERED WITH A LAYER OF DOLOMITE, AND MOST OF THE LEAD BULLETS ARE CAPTURED IN THE DOLOMITE LAYER.  AFTER A PERIOD OF 10 TO 15 YEARS, THE DOLOMITE BECOMES SATURATED WITH LEAD BULLETS AND MUST BE REPLACED.  THE REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE BULLETS CAN RICOCHET FROM THE SATURATED DOLOMITE, CAUSING A SAFETY HAZARD TO SECURITY PERSONNEL.    NORMALLY, THE LEAD-CONTAMINATED DOLOMITE WOULD BE COMPLETELY REMOVED AND DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THEN NEW DOLOMITE WOULD BE PURCHASED AND APPLIED TO THE BERMS TO REPLACE THE REMOVED MATERIAL.  FOR THIS PROJECT, PANTEX PERSONNEL WERE DETERMINED TO FIND A WAY TO RECYCLE THE LARGE QUANTITY OF MATERIAL TO BE REMOVED FROM THE BERMS.  A CONTRACTOR WAS LOCATED WITH CAPABILITIES TO FILTER AND CLEAN THE DOLOMITE SO THAT A MAJORITY OF THE MATERIAL COULD BE RECOVERED AND REAPPLIED TO THE BERMS.  THIS APPROACH PROVED TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL BOTH IN REDUCING COSTS AND THE QUANTITY OF HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATED.   REPLACEMENT OF THE DOLOMITE WITHOUT RECYCLING WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE GENERATION OF 1,440 TONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.  BY IMPLEMENTING THIS RECYCLING PROJECT TO FILTER AND REUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE DOLOMITE, ONLY 24 TONS OF WASTE WERE GENERATED AND DISPOSED.  THIS REPRESENTS A 98% REDUCTION IN HAZARDOUS WASTE AND A CORRESPONDING COST SAVINGS OF $422,800 IN REDUCED SHIPPING AND DISPOSAL COSTS.  BY REUSING THE FILTERED DOLOMITE, PANTEX ALSO AVOIDED PURCHASING APPROXIMATELY 1,500 TONS OF NEW DOLOMITE FOR AN ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS OF $28,365.  BY TAKING THE INITIATIVE FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS, THE PANTEX TEAM INVOLVED WITH THIS PROJECT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING 1,416 TONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE OUT OF A LANDFILL WHILE REDUCING COSTS BY MORE THAN $450,000.

THE CAUSE OF ONE RELEASE WAS A COMBINATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND A FAULTY VALVE AND/OR GASKET ON A RECOVERY TANK, RESULTING IN THE PURCHASE OF 6,000 POUNDS OF NEW HCFC-22 TO REPLACE THE RELEASED HCFC-22 WHICH HAD BEEN RECOVERED FROM EQUIPMENT IN PREPARATION FOR REPAIRS. IN ADDITION, CONTAMINATED HCFC-22 FROM ANOTHER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WAS SENT OFF-SITE FOR RECYCLING RESULTING IN THE USE OF 3,500 POUNDS OF NEW HCFC-22 TO CLEAN AND REPLACE THE HCFC-22 THAT WAS CONTAMINATED.  IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO RELEASE TO THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE CHILLER AND RECOVERY TANK WERE SENT OFF-SITE FOR RECYCLING. UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS WE WOULD EXPECT TO USE NO MORE THAN 500 POUNDS OF HCFC-22 TO RECHARGE EACH CHILLER RESULTING IN AN ANNUAL USAGE OF ABOUT 3,000 POUNDS PER YEAR.  WHEN A LEAK IS DISCOVERED THAT CANNOT BE QUICKLY REPAIRED, THE CHILLER IS EVACUATED TO A RECOVERY TANK AND THE RECOVERED HCFC-22 IS REUSED. THIS YEAR WE HAD TWO ABNORMAL EVENTS THAT CAUSED US TO EXCEED OUR ACTIVITY THRESHOLD FOR THIS CHEMICAL.  WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THIS HAPPENING AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

THIS HAS WORKED VERY WELL IN REDUCING LEAD CONCENTRATIONS ON THE PAD, WHICH IN TURN MINIMIZES THE LEAD CONCENTRATIONS IN THE STORMWATER RUNOFF. REGARDLESS, PERIODIC MONITORING HAS SHOWN VERY SLIGHT TRACES OF PARTICULATE LEAD AND DISSOLVED LEAD IN THE STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM THE CONCRETE PAD. HENCE THE CHANGE IN DISCHARGES TO WATER BODIES FROM "NA" TO "1 TO 10 LBS". IN REVIEWING 2010 TRI DATA, A MISCALCULATION WAS DISCOVERED. THE FUGITIVE AIR EMISSIONS FOR 2010 SHOULD HAVE BEEN 5.1805 LBS VERSUS 4.1472 LBS. INSTEAD OF AN INCREASE FROM 2010 TO 2011 AS THE REPORT IS SHOWING, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DECREASE OF 4%. NORMALLY, THE BASE SENDS OUT 2 SHIPMENTS OF LEAD TO BE RECYCLED. DURING 2011, ONLY 1 SHIPMENT WENT OUT, BUT ON 1/12/12 A SHIPMENT WENT BUT THAT WILL BE COUNTED FOR 2012. BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF OUR SHIPMENTS, IT SHOWS A DECREASE OF 74.2% IN OUR RECYCLING. I EXPECT 2012'S RECYCLING AMOUNT TO BE MUCH HIGHER.

A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE CONTAMINATED WOOD UNDERWENT LABORATORY ANALYSIS AND WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE A LEAD CONTENT OF 90.4 MG/KG.  BECAUSE OFF-SITE DISPOSAL OF THIS TYPE COULD CONCEIVABLY OCCUR AGAIN, IT WAS NOT REPORTED AS A ONE-TIME EVENT NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION PROCESSES IN SECTION 8.8; BUT 0 LBS ARE INDICATED FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND SECOND FOLLOWING YEAR IN SECTION 8.1 BECAUSE ANY SUCH EVENT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR RARELY AND ON A NON-SCHEDULED/AS-NEEDED BASIS ONLY.  THE NOTABLE 30% REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF REPORTABLE LEAD ON THE TRI FORM R FROM RY2011, COMPARED TO RY2010, IS DUE TO IMPROVED DATA COLLECTION AND MORE ACCURATE METRICS PROVIDED BY THE 9TH SECURITY FORCES ON THE NUMBERS OF ROUNDS EXPENDED AT EACH OF THE INSTALLATION RANGES FOR THE 2011 CALENDAR YEAR. DATA PROVIDED WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NON-EXEMPT TRAINING ACTIVITIES OF ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL.  IN CONTRAST WITH THIS REDUCTION, THE 3-FOLD INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF REPORTABLE LEAD INDICATED FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND THE SECOND FOLLOWING YEAR IN SECTION 8.1 IS EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF A NEW COURSE OF FIRE ORDER ISSUED IN 2012 THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF MILITARY TRAINING ACTIVITIES BEING CONDUCTED AT BEALE AFB RANGES.

THIS WASTE ACCUMULATES AND IS SHIPPED OFF TO A COMPANY THAT INJECTS THIS NEUTRALIZED WASTE INTO A WELL. IT WAS CALCULATED THAT 3,615LB BF3 WAS INSIDE OUR SCRUBBER TANK AT ONE POINT IN 2011 AND SHIPPED FOR DISPOSAL.  2010 THE SCRUBBER WAS NOT EMPTIED NOR DID IT HAVE IT'S CONTENTS SHIPPED AWAY TO BE DEEP WELL INJECTED.  THAT IS THE REASON WHY 2011 HAD A HIGHER AMOUNT OF TREATED WASTE GENERATED SINCE IN 2010 WE DIDN'T GENERATE WASTE SINCE IT STAYED IN THE SYSTEM.  OUR SITE DOES NOT MAKE BF3 WE JUST RE PACKAGE IT FOR A FEW OF OUR CUSTOMERS.	NO	JLAWS@GULBRANDSEN.COM			YES
