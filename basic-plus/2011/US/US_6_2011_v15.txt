EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

BMC Holdings, Inc. (BMC), a subsidiary of Terra Industries, Inc. (Terra), owned and operated a chemical manufacturing facility in Beaumont, TX from 1992 to 2008.  Effective January 1, 2009 Terra sold BMC to Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman).  In December 2009 Eastman issued a News Release of their decision to terminate business opportunities at the Beaumont Facility.  In April 2011, Eastman sold the Beaumont Facility to Pandora Methanol LLC (Pandora), which at that time Pandora was owned by Janus Methanol (Janus) and OCI.  In November 2011, OCI acquired 100% ownership of the BMC assets.  BMC and Terra understand that the Beaumont Facility is in the process of a name change to OCI North America.  When Eastman purchased BMC from Terra, a service agreement/contract was signed to lease certain of the terminal assets back to Terra/BMC for continuing operation as a methanol terminal.  This agreement/contract continued in effect when Pandora purchased the Beaumont Facility from Eastman.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

After investigation it was found that this contaminant was brought in on the oil of a job lot and decreased the efficiency of the degreaser by sticking to the water jacket and reducing the degreaser capacity to condense water.  This resulted in an increase in the acidity of the degreaser and a decrease in the efficiency.  A full cleanout was performed and waste trichloroethylene was shipped offsite.  This is shown in the increase of waste volume from 2010 levels.  No violation of the current Title V permit occurred, however this decreased efficiency caused the emissions from this chemical to approach the maximum permit levels.  An increase in the frequency of cleaning this equipment has been taken to insure that this equipment is running at design efficiency.	NO	CBERTRAND@CHEMPROCESSING.COM			NO

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

No other waste streams were generated and no BF3 entered land nor water streams. BF3 is a gas.  We react BF3 with water in our scrubber to neutralize it making it non hazardous.  This waste accumulates and is shipped off to a company that injects this neutralized waste into a well. It was calculated that 3,615Lb BF3 was inside our scrubber tank at one point in 2011 and shipped for disposal.  2010 the scrubber was not emptied nor did it have it's contents shipped away to be deep well injected.  That is the reason why 2011 had a higher amount of treated waste generated since in 2010 we didn't generate waste since it stayed in the system.

On-going problem solving to improve first time yields is a contributing factor.  Employees identify problems in the process that cause a product to fall out or need repair, and then 'problem solve' to eliminate the root cause and prevent the problems from reoccuring when that job is run again.  This method of problem solving that drills down to a specific product and problem can prevent a knee jerk reaction to a problem that could potentially create problems for other products in the line.

This has worked very well in reducing lead concentrations on the pad, which in turn minimizes the lead concentrations in the stormwater runoff. Regardless, periodic monitoring has shown very slight traces of particulate lead and dissolved lead in the stormwater runoff from the concrete pad. Hence the change in discharges to water bodies from "NA" to "1 to 10 lbs". In reviewing 2010 TRI data, a miscalculation was discovered. The fugitive air emissions for 2010 should have been 5.1805 lbs versus 4.1472 lbs. Instead of an increase from 2010 to 2011 as the report is showing, there should have been a decrease of 4%. Normally, the base sends out 2 shipments of lead to be recycled. During 2011, only 1 shipment went out, but on 1/12/12 a shipment went but that will be counted for 2012. Because of the timing of our shipments, it shows a decrease of 74.2% in our recycling. I expect 2012's recycling amount to be much higher.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

Spincraft is a job shop having a variable production mix, hence the use, production ratio and production related waste for a TRI chemical may vary greatly from year to year and may not correlate with each other.  The amount of trimmings sent to be recycled (production related waste) varies depending on the product being made.  The recycling facility to which the metal scrap is being sent, is not a generator of hazardous waste, therefore indicates to Spincraft that they do not have a RCRA ID #.  The state DEP indicates they are registered only as a VSQG of waste oil having a number = MV7818219995.  This metal recycling facility also verifies that their zip code is correct as listed. Fugitive emissions are being estimated for RY2011 using the more conservative "range" rather than an absolute value.  The solid waste management company, Waste Management, for which a "0" release is reported is listed as incidental, negligible, immeasurable amounts may be released into the regular trash.

Because of that we had to go back 5 years and make up for lost time.  During that time we were able to get our lead processing streams under control and visible which helped to make our 2011 report somewhat more reasonable.  Also, due to the nature of our business our customer base transitioned more of their products to lead-free processing and away from tin-lead processing which helped to reduce how much lead was handled.  Also during 2011 we only sent dross to our toxic waste handler once which reduced the amount of lead being reported through that waste stream.  Some years will have a couple of toxic waste shipments driving up that number so that will be a variable from year to year.  In that regards, estimates for the next two years has been increased to cover the possibility of two shipments.	NO	CHERYL@MFG-SERVICES.COM			YES

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

In the RY2011 there was a significant increase in our customer orders.  Because of the increase in orders we started running both the Continuous and Batch Plant Extractors Simultaneously.    We do not normally operate our Extraction Plants simultaneously or on an alternating back and forth production schedule.  Doing this higher level of production along with the starting-up and shutting-down or simultaneously running the Extractors has contributed to the overall increase of fugitive emissions.    In addition, to the increased production and the alternating production schedule; the Batch Plant carbon beds became saturated and had to be changed with fresh carbon; it was also discovered at that time that two of the carbon system valves were not functioning correctly.

It appears to be a trend for the coming years moving away from standard white and off white colors.  Although the HAP contents have increased our facility still operates will within the emission limitations for HAP's listed in EPA's NESHAP for Reinforced Plastics.  This would be the explanation for why the emissions might have increased slightly more than the production ratio.  Also the part sizes seem to be getting larger.

Previously, the mean of the concentration in the effluent from the wastewater pre-treatment operation and the mean of the concentration in the offsite fuel blend waste stream were used to estiamte the quantities.  After a review of the spread of the concentration values used to estimate the mean, it has been determined that this mean is not truly representative of the quantities.   During the previous year Dichloromethane was recovered and in some situations reused  in the process.  During 2011, Dichoromethane was not reused in the process and this resulted in an increased total usage of the fresh chemical sitewide for the year.  Most of the dichloromethane used in the process ends up in the wastewater stream. This is evident in the data in this report as follows; The  facility is reporting a 204.4% change in the total quantity of production-related waste (sum of Sections 8.1 through 8.7, Column B) of Dichloromethane as compared to the prior year. The prior year's form for this chemical included 80361.22 lbs of total production-related waste and the current year's form includes 244622.0 lbs of total production-related waste.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

Crafco has not previously submitted a report for this facility because Crafco did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While Crafco does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, Crafco employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

Crafco has not previously submitted a report for this facility because Crafco did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While Crafco does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, Crafco employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

Although there is no definitive reason behind the reduction, there was a modification to the method of handling the solids from the wastewater clarifiers @ 6 months prior to the reporting year 2011. Prior to that time, the clarifier solids were reintroduced into the headworks of the anaerobic lagoons & removed from the lagoon bottom throughout the year to a sludge storage basin.. A redirecting of the solids directly to the sludge storage pond has resulted in additional treatment capacity in the anaerobic lagoons which may have affected nitrate compound generation.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

This results in a more accurate estimate of cleanup xylene emitted as a stack emission versus the amount of cleanup xylene sent to waste. This is because waste paint is fixed at 28 ounces per day and the amount of cleanup waste is calculated by subtracting paint waste and other alcohol waste from the total ampount of solvent waste generated at the facility.

In 2010, the facility conservatively estimated all water discharged to the POTW potentially contained tobacco and nicotine, including construction use waters.  Off-site transfer to the landfill was less because facility construction was complete.  In 2010, a conservative estimate was made that all wastes hauled off from the facility could contain tobacco waste and nicotine.  Thus, off-site transfer of nicotine declined in 2011 because of less construction waste. Air release of nicotine increase due to the vacudyne tobacco process coming on line in 2011.

While EAE does not believe had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count.For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

For example, a process that moves millions of tons of material with a constituent concentration change of a few parts per million may result in a significant increase or decrease in reported releases.  Such increases or decreases can easily fall outside of the 5% change specified within TRI-ME software and may spur additional clarification on how that change can occur.

(ETI) toxic release inventory (TRI) report for Reporting Year 2011.  ETI has not recently submitted a report for this facility because ETI did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While ETI does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, ETI employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

(2) Also, during calendar year 2011, a remediation project was implemented at the Firing Range which generated a significant amount of lead waste that significantly increased the lead release quantities at Pantex.  The outdoor portion of the Firing Range at the Pantex Plant is used by Security personnel for firearms practice and training.  The Firing Range has several earthen berms that bullets are fired into during training exercises.  These berms are covered with a layer of dolomite, and most of the lead bullets are captured in the dolomite layer.  After a period of 10 to 15 years, the dolomite becomes saturated with lead bullets and must be replaced.  The replacement is necessary because bullets can ricochet from the saturated dolomite, causing a safety hazard to Security personnel.    Normally, the lead-contaminated dolomite would be completely removed and disposed of as hazardous waste and then new dolomite would be purchased and applied to the berms to replace the removed material.  For this project, Pantex personnel were determined to find a way to recycle the large quantity of material to be removed from the berms.  A contractor was located with capabilities to filter and clean the dolomite so that a majority of the material could be recovered and reapplied to the berms.  This approach proved to be very successful both in reducing costs and the quantity of hazardous waste generated.   Replacement of the dolomite without recycling would have resulted in the generation of 1,440 tons of hazardous waste.  By implementing this recycling project to filter and reuse the majority of the dolomite, only 24 tons of waste were generated and disposed.  This represents a 98% reduction in hazardous waste and a corresponding cost savings of $422,800 in reduced shipping and disposal costs.  By reusing the filtered dolomite, Pantex also avoided purchasing approximately 1,500 tons of new dolomite for an additional cost savings of $28,365.  By taking the initiative for sustainability and cost effectiveness, the Pantex team involved with this project was successful in keeping 1,416 tons of hazardous waste out of a landfill while reducing costs by more than $450,000.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

The cause of one release was a combination of high temperature and a faulty valve and/or gasket on a recovery tank, resulting in the purchase of 6,000 pounds of new HCFC-22 to replace the released HCFC-22 which had been recovered from equipment in preparation for repairs. In addition, contaminated HCFC-22 from another piece of equipment was sent off-site for recycling resulting in the use of 3,500 pounds of new HCFC-22 to clean and replace the HCFC-22 that was contaminated.  In this case there was no release to the environment, the entire contents of the chiller and recovery tank were sent off-site for recycling. Under normal operating conditions we would expect to use no more than 500 pounds of HCFC-22 to recharge each chiller resulting in an annual usage of about 3,000 pounds per year.  When a leak is discovered that cannot be quickly repaired, the chiller is evacuated to a recovery tank and the recovered HCFC-22 is reused. This year we had two abnormal events that caused us to exceed our activity threshold for this chemical.  We do not anticipate this happening again in the future.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

In past years we were not tracking the amount of chromium going to the landfill.  We have better data now and can provide an actual amount based on percentage of chromium in waste olivine sand sent to the landfill.  We believe this number is high, based on the fact that some of the chromium burns out during the molding process, but we do not have a way to determine what that amount is and therefore state the entire amount.  2. We are now using a welding rod that contains manganese, nickel, and chromium on our castings.  I know from Hygiene testing that a certain amount of these metals escapes as fume and therefore would be fugitive emissions.  The total weight of metals in the total pounds of this welding rod used is Chromium: 167.4 lbs; Nickel:  37.2 lbs.; and Manganese: 372 lbs.  I used the range field of 11-499 lbs. as an estimate and believe the amount released would be closer to 11 than to 499, but do not have any way of extracting that data.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

During fermentation, the yeast used to convert the sugar to ethyl alcohol metabolizes the acetaldehyde.  Acetaldehyde emissions are also generated during wet feed drying.  Emissions are reduced by the thermal   oxidizers.  The change in potential release from 2010 to 2011 reporting year is due to emissions testing that was conducted in January of 2012 at maximum production rate, and site specific emissions factors are based on emissions during testing.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

For example, a process that moves millions of tons of material with a constituent concentration change of a few parts per million may result in a significant increase or decrease in reported releases.  Such increases or decreases can easily fall outside of the 5% change specified within TRI-ME software and may spur additional clarification on how that change can occur.    With such small fluctuations in mineral concentrations in an ore body, such fluctuations are common and seen year-to-year with TRI reporting.	NO	KYLE.BENNETT@RIOTINTO.COM			YES

We implemented a new process last year in which we bring neat DCM on-site and blend finished goods with it (rather than purchase pre-blend chemicals) in order to save money.    However, we found out after several sizable batches that our metering system was not properly registering DCM.  In fact, we were overpumping, i.e. using more than we anticipated.  Unforuntely, our quality control checks were not able to detect this, and these excess usages were not discovered in time to fully and accurately be able to account for them.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

For example, a process that moves millions of tons of material with a constituent concentration change of a few parts per million may result in a significant increase or decrease in reported releases.  Such increases or decreases can easily fall outside of the 5% change specified within TRI-Me software and may spur additional clarification on how that change can occur.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

Added a tank to catch a drip from chrome exhaust.  Another thing happening was discovery of Aluminum metal impurity introduced while plating hollow tubes was detrimental to plating process, it generated large amount of scrap of finished product. Temporary solution has been to decant chrome plating baths to lower Aluminum concentration and build it it back with fresh chrome bath ingredients. The decanted plating solution has been sent for treatment to off site treatment facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

The concentration changed from 68 ppm Mn (published value) to 88.37 ppm Mn(actual coal result).  Additionally, the increase was also partly due to removing dewatered ash at the facility that was previously accounted for in the prior years and shipping the ash to a permanent disposal facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

As a result the treatment off site number for 2010 was approximately 36% greater than 2011.  The reduction in 2011 was not the result of changes directly attributed to routine processing.  There were also some reductions in off site disposal and energy recovery also the result of this dismantling activity.

(EA) has not previously submitted a report for this facility because (EA) did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While (EA) does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, (EA) employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

A representative sample of the contaminated wood underwent laboratory analysis and was determined to have a lead content of 90.4 mg/kg.  Because off-site disposal of this type could conceivably occur again, it was not reported as a one-time event not associated with production processes in section 8.8; but 0 lbs are indicated for the following year and second following year in section 8.1 because any such event is expected to occur rarely and on a non-scheduled/as-needed basis only.  The notable 30% reduction in the amount of reportable lead on the TRI Form R from RY2011, compared to RY2010, is due to improved data collection and more accurate metrics provided by the 9th Security Forces on the numbers of rounds expended at each of the installation ranges for the 2011 calendar year. Data provided were attributable to the non-exempt training activities of active-duty personnel.  In contrast with this reduction, the 3-fold increase in the amount of reportable lead indicated for the following year and the second following year in section 8.1 is expected as a result of a new course of fire order issued in 2012 that significantly increased the amount of military training activities being conducted at Beale AFB ranges.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

In previous years the amount of HCL treated (reported in Section 8.6) has been incorrectly calculated because the treatment system took the HCL present from the Dust Cyclone to Incineration.  Therefore the amount of HCL treated in Section 8.6 incorrectly included the amount of HCL that was processed as a by-product. The Treatment System for HCL prior to emission to the atmosphere begins at the Caustic Scrubber and proceeds to incineration. Therefore, Section 7A has been changed to accurately reflect the Treatment System for HCL to Incineration and Section 8.6 is accurately reflects the amount of HCL remaining in the Off-Gas after HCL is removed from the Off-Gas, condensed to hydrochloric acid, and separated as a by-product. As a result, Section 8.6 is substantially lower than previously reported. Corrections to previous years are being submitted.	NO	TIM.HALL@LAPIGMENT.COM	RR5		NO

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.|REV:The RCRA ID was incorrectly noted as "Not Applicable" in the original submittal.

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

As 1) a process chemical, the % by weight is below the 1% de minimis, as 2) otherwise use the % by weight is above the 1% de minimis.    For the 2011 reporting year, "otherwise use" amounts of materials containing metal constituents qualified manganese for TRI reporting (where previous years' usage was such that  otherwise use for manganese was below the 10,000 lb/year threshold).  It is important to note that per TRI guidance, regardless that manganese qualifyied for only one of the two activities mentioned above, all releases and recycling represent both activities (total for the facility), not just for the qualifying activity. As a result, release and recycling amounts for the previous reporting year, 2010, should not be related or compared to either of the qualifying activity reporting thresholds (i.e. compared to the 25,000 process threshold, or 10,000 otherwise use threshold).

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

The original individual units stacks remain such that flue gases can by-Pass the scrubber to allow for scrubber maintenance without impacting generation availability.  To calculate the aerosol discharge the by-Pass scrubber fraction, in addition to that of the common stack, is required.  Our review of the 2011 TRI form r submittal has revealed that the originally submitted by-Pass fraction (52%) was in error.  The correct fraction is 9.92%.  The resubmitted form rS reflect the changes in emissions.  Reportable metals corrections: to calculate the reportable metals the percentage of beneficially use ash is a factor in the calculation.

In 2009 and 2010 thee facility exceeded reporting thresholds for lead and lead compounds; however, the waste was not disposed of until 2011 so there were no releases. The lead comes from lead tetra oxide found in the epoxy used for molding. Note per the MSDS this epoxy is not volatile. PPE used during the molding process as well as waste molding is properly disposed of hazardous waste. This waste is stabilized. The facilty also uses lead sheets that are article exempt; however, in 2011 an R&D process began that required a few lead sheets to be cut which is not exempt. There are no emissions as a result of this process however the cut pieces are directly placed into a container for metal recovery.	NO	SKORLIPARA@VJT.COM			YES

DOD guidelines require separate reporting for lead utilized in range and non-range activities.  Range activities are located at two locations at the facility, an indoor small arms range and an Emergency OB/OD site.  The small arms range is located indoors and is equipped with bullet traps and pollution control devices for the building's exhaust ventilation.  The OB/OD site is a small emergency and training site with a Burn Pan.  Therefore, although range activities cause the otherwise use threshold quantitites for lead to be exceeded, due to the design of the facilities and procedures in place, very little lead is released to the environment.  All air and land release estimates were estimated using the DOD's TRI-DDS reporting tool for munitions and range activities.	YES	SILVIA.KLATMAN@NAVY.MIL			YES

EAE has not previously submitted a report for this facility because EAE did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While EAE does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, EAE employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.|REV:The RCRA ID was incorrectly noted as "Not Applicable" in the original submittal.

If you determine that your calculations are correct, please disregard this DQA.          SDI RESPONSE: Information became available in 2011 from nonhazardous landfill activities that now allow us to include the laboratory and quantities in TRI determination. (See sec 8.1c).    Note: We elected to exclude the de minimis amount for sec 8.5 as a conservative approach to reporting.

The ammonia is being coincidentally manufactured while processing raw materials for cement clinker (kiln) production. Per discussion with USEPA TRI Hotline, since CEMS measure NH3 and are certified using Conditional Reference Method 027 for ammonia,the threshold determination and release calculations are based on 100% or anhydrous ammonia. In addition, a small amount of ammonia is measured in leachate discharge from old closed landfill.	NO	JOHN.MILLER@FAIRBORNCEMENT.COM			NO

(EA) has not previously submitted a report for this facility because (EA) did not have ten or more full-time equivalent employees at the facility to trigger a reporting obligation under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  While (EA) does not believe it had 10 or more full-time equivalent employees during the reporting year, it has become increasingly difficult to track and determine the employee count in the manner suggested in EPA's guidance.  For example, (EA) employees that are not "based" at the facility, and work with multiple facilities, do not track their hours on a facility by facility basis.  Finally, it is unclear which work performed by contractors should be included and excluded from the employee count. For these reasons, we have elected to begin submitting TRI reports for this facility unless and until we can develop an effective system for tracking hours spent by employees and nonemployee contractors at the facility.

For example, a process that moves millions of tons of material with a constituent concentration change of a few parts per million may result in a significant increase or decrease in reported releases.  Such increases or decreases can easily fall outside of the 5% change specified within TRI-Me software and may spur additional clarification on how that change can occur.

However our production ratio based specifically on copper decreased at a ratio of .89 in comparison to 2010.  At the same time we saw a large increase in scrap copper sent offsite for recycling.  I think the reason for this is because since July of 2011 we have been in the process of introducing a large number of new units from a sister plant that closed.  I believe the large amount of scrap is due to the learning curve as we learn to build new parts made of copper for the new units.	NO	MISTY_GARTNER@IRCO.COM			YES

The Form R reports for these years are being revised and resubmitted to address this. (The revised reports also reflect current contact and related information.) Also, based on the facility's compliance review, it concluded that the more appropriate entry for Section 5.2 of RY 2008 - 2012 Form R reports for Ammonia is 0, rather than "NA".

Upon this discovery, LPI contacted our chemical supplier to investigate past purchases of the biocide to determine if reporting was required prior to RY2014.  From information provided by our chemical supplier, it was determined that LPIs usage exceeded the reporting threshold for Nabam (CAS#142-59-6) and Sodium Dimethyldithrocarbamate (CAS#128-04-1) for Reporting Years 2011, 2012, and 2013.

Please verify that the metals are in wastewater that is being sent to a POTW. If the metals are in wastewater or other wastes that are being sent off-site to a recovery or recycling facility, this should be entered in Transfers to Other Offsite Locations and not in Transfers to POTWs.       -  SDI REPONSE: The release is verified. 2) FIX: You checked the "Not Applicable" box for the off-site location EPA Identification Number (i.e., RCRA Identification Number) which means that you are transferring waste containing a toxic chemical to an off-site location in another country, or that you are transferring waste containing a toxic chemical to an off-site location in the U.S. that does not have an EPA Identification Number. Please verify that this is correct.       -  SDI REPONSE: Verified. Data Quality Alerts: 1) MSG: According to our preliminary analysis, your facility reported a 37.9% change in the total quantity of production-related waste (sum of Sections 8.1 through 8.7, Column B) of Lead Compounds as compared to the prior year. The prior year's form for this chemical included 396913.16 lbs of total production-related waste and the current year's form includes 547196.76 lbs of total production-related waste. Please review your calculations to ensure accuracy. If you determine that your calculations are correct, please disregard this data quality alert.        - SDI RESPONSE: Waste generation increases are partially the cause for increases in Sec 8. In addition, for the 2011 reporting year SDI elected to disregard the de minimis exception for sec 8.5 as a conservative approach to reporting. This conservative approach triggered new or increased reported amounts for some chemicals. 2) MSG: According to our preliminary analysis, your facility reported a 98.8% change in the total release quantity (sum of Sections 8.1a, 8.1b, 8.1c, and 8.1d, Column B) of Lead Compounds as compared to the prior year. The prior year's form for this chemical included 2587.16 lbs of total releases and the current year's form includes 31.259999999999998 lbs of total releases. Please review your calculations to ensure accuracy. If you determine that your calculations are correct, please disregard this data quality alert.       -  SDI RESPONSE: New laboratory analyses and waste generation increases contribute to the increases in Sec 8.FORM R REVISION: In its review of the RY 2013 mercury air emissions total, SDI has become aware that in past Form R submittals, it has reported its lead air emissions in the wrong units in the Form R air emission section, inadvertently reporting in tons instead of pounds.

Upon this notice, we reviewed all TRI data submitted since TransCanada acquired this facility in 2009. While the number listed in the notice from EPA is due to a new emissions factor which we have not taken into account in our resubmission of data, it did lead us to a closer inspection of previously submitted reports. In our review of our old CEMS data we noticed that there must have been an error in the algorithm that calculated our old data reports, since the Ammonia numbers were all rather low considering the use of SCR by our Combined Cycle facility. The CEMS software was changed in the end of 2011 and all subsequent data is correct. However, after an evaluation of the raw data from 2009 through 2011, we did notice that the Ammonia emissions from this facility were higher than what was previously reported. Therefore, we are now submitting corrected data for Ammonia for 2009, 2010 and 2011.	NO	TANJA.GRZESKOWITZ@ETHOSENERGYGROUP.COM	RR4		NO

The campus consists of NSK Corporation, 1100 N. First Street and NSK-AKS Precision Ball Company, 1100A N. First Street, Clarinda, IA.  Where appropriate, input values for chromium as well as waste disposal values have been added together in this report. Response to DQA regarding facility failure to submit a Form R for the prior reporting year: The facility did not previously submit Form R reports for chromium based on the conclusion that steel alloy items received and processed at the facility met the definition of an article and were exempt from reporting under 40 CFR Section 372.38(b).  The facility recently determined, however, that the article exemption was inapplicable to the steel alloy items processed in 2014 and accordingly the facility also likely processed chromium in quantities above the threshold amount in prior reporting years. The facility voluntarily reported the determination to EPA Region 7 pursuant to EPAs audit policy on June 26, 2015 and is in the process of preparing Form R Reports for the prior reporting years.|PRAI:Calculated based on parts produced at two different facilities.

The correct value, based on source testing performed in 1996 for the relevant process line, is 78.1 lb/year as stack or point source air emissions, and not 8.12 lb/yr as previously identified. The RY 2013 Form R report includes the corrected, 78.1 lb/yr figure. Because the relevant molten lead process operates at mostly steady state conditions, estimated lead air emissions from this process are not expected to change significantly from year-to-year. As a result, the facility believes that the previously reported lead emission values are incorrect, and is revising and resubmitting its Form R reports for the past 5 years to reflect the 78.1 lb/year figure.   REV RR5: In reviewing the facility's Form R reports, it was discovered that the reports for RYs 2009 - 2013 included only the facility's secondary NAICS code (423510, Metal Service Centers and Other Metal Merchant Wholesalers) and inadvertently identified this code as the primary NAICS Code (which is 332811, Metal Heat Treating).

In 2012, we discovered that our report did not capture miscellaneous methanol usage, so we revised our tracking efforts to include this usage for 2012.  It was not until preparing the report for 2013 that we realized we had not made an adjustment for 2011.  Due to a software change in mid-2011, we did not realize the need to make this adjustment to our reporting system.  That year there were both SAP reports and a miscellaneous methanol report, so the partial omission wasnt obvious.

After consulting with the Form R Help Desk (Case no. 305,994), it was suggested that H-D Motor Co - Tomahawk simply "Use Current Year Quantities" and provide this narrative in Section 9.1.
