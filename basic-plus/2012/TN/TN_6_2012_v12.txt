The production mix changed dramatically in 2012 from 2011.Explanation: The major contributor to the facility release is chrome bearing sludge generated by pretreatment of waste water from chrome plating activities. The production of parts for chrome plating was drastically decreased  while production of other parts that generated waste water increased significantly. The more waste water to be treated, the more sludge that is generated. It is then conceivable that the content of the chrome in the sludge is considerably less that the factor used to calculate the totals for this report. However, the quantities used were on the basis of the most recent information available.
