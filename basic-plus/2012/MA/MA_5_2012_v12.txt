It is highly regulated and the chloroform can only be used once.  This is a closed loop system with zero emissions to air and 100% of the chloroform used is transported off-site as hazardous waste for incineration. DePuy is researching options for a process that will permit a single re-use of the chloroform, which would halve the amount required at present production volumes.  There may be growth in this sector, so the goal is to minimize the use of chloroform while maximizing the production of this product. DePuy has a model from one of its sister companies that re-uses the chloroform once, and that system will be installed at this facility in 2014.

Fly ash reduces the quantity of cement needed to produce a yard of concrete. Benefits: Use of fly ash reduces the quantity of cement needed to produce a given volume of ready-mix concrete mixture. This result in a smaller quantity of lead for a given volume of concrete only when fly ash lead concentrations are lower than those found in cement.Obstacles: Fly ash contains similar lead concentrations as cement. Therefore, fly ash use will not significantly reduce the lead concentration in the ready-mix product. Higher fly ash concentrations increase curing time affecting the products value to customers. Fly ash sources are limited and variable. Market forces affect availability.2012 Update: In 2012 Preferred Concrete obtained permission by the Town of Freetown to transport fly ash within the limits of the Town, a practice that was previously prohibited by the Town. As a result, Preferred is considering for future application use of fly ash in its ready mix concrete formulations. Fly ash is a byproduct of coal combustion. Energy production from combustion of coal has diminished recently due to the cost, availability, and use of natural gas. This, coupled with the recent shortage of fly ash from power plant shut downs has reduced the availability and increased the cost of fly ash in Massachusetts. Preferred continues to investigate this option and will implement it if and when it makes good business sense.	NO	PREFERREDSUE@AOL.COM			YES
