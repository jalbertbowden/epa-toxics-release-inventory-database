The Section 313 chemicals in scrap metal we send offsite for recycling is not being reported as had been done in previous years.588. If a covered facility sends metal scraps containing chromium off-siteto be remelted and subsequently reused, does it report the amount oftoxic chemical in the metal as recycled off-site?Assuming no contaminants are removed during the melting process, thechromium in the metal scraps is not actually being recovered but merelymelted and reused. Therefore, the amount of the toxic chemical in the metalscraps would not be reportable in Part II, Sections 6.2 or 8 of the Form R.However, because the facility is repackaging and distributing the toxicchemicals in commerce, it should consider these amounts of the toxicchemical towards the facility¿s processing threshold. If the covered facilityexceeds a chemical activity threshold, it is required to file a TRI Report forthat chemical.	NO	STEVEN.LEUS@BUZZIUNICEMUSA.COM			YES
