Our best selling and largest products are made on molds that close and are vacuum sealed during injection and catalyzation (curing).  This is state of the art technology in the fiberglass manufacturing industry.  Closed molding technology reduces our styrene emissions to a fraction of what is common for open molding processes.  The products we currently manufacture using open mold production processes are low sales volume products or products that are not adaptable to closed molding technology.	NO	EBALL@ORENCO.COM			NO
