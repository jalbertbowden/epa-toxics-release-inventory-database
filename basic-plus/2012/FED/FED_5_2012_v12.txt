When the wooden baffles, impregnated with lead from the firing of rounds, need replacing, the weight totals for lead waste debris increase significantly due to the weight of the wood.|SRNA:Pollution prevention previously implemented - additional reduction does not appear technically or economically feasible. All of the lead waste and lead releases are generated at the Base Portsmouth outdoor small arms firing range. Pollution prevention procedures are closely followed to minimize the lead concentrations in the stormwater discharges and there is no way feasible to capture fugitive emmissions at an outdoor firing range. The only way to improve the pollution prevention capabilities would be to construct an indoor firing range which would eliminate lead being discharged into the stormwater discharges and it would also eliminate fugitive emmissions from the firing of rounds. Unfortunately, at this time, constructing an indoor firing range is not economically feasible.	YES	CHRISTOPHER.S.OLLICE@USCG.MIL			YES
