This may have inadvertently not been reported in this manner for previous years, although the wastewater was transferred to the same POTWs and contained nitrates as in 2012.   We do not anticipate the need to transfer a significant amount of nitrate-containing wastewater to POTWs in future years due to construction of additional on-site wastewater storage.   This additional on-site storage will provide sufficient over-winter storage capacity to allow for spray-irrigation (land treatment) of most, if not all, of nitrate-containing wastewater for future years.    Wastewater containing nitrates was spray-irrigated on agricultural fields (land treatment).   Since this is a release of nitrates to the soils, this was reported as a release of nitrates to the environment.   However,  the soils and plants treat nitrates at a very high efficiency.

We anticipate a slow but steady increase in CY2013 and CY2014, and have estimated an additional 20% emissions each year, based solely on increased throughput.  Waste management and emission control processes will remain unchanged.A dedicated emission control system (wet scrubber) serves the nitric acid processing. Amounts listed as emitted through stacks in earlier reports appear to be considerably too high, and may have been based on raw emissions going into the air pollution control system, rather than on emissions from the air pollution control system stack. This accounts for the significant reduction in listed emissions from the air pollution control system for RY 2012 as compared to RY 2011.  The CCI facility in Phoenix has similar nitric acid processes and emission control systems systems, with very low stack emissions.	NO	KMALLIET@COLUMBUSCHEMICAL.COM			NO
