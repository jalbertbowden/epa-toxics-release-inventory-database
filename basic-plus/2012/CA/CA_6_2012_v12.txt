Employees are expected to report 1-2 minimum monthly issues. A 5 "S" program has been implemented and maintained where all stored wastes have been identified and removed. Areas maintained organized and clean at all times. A Material Control program was also introduced where just enough material is ordered to avoid overstocking and prevent shortages. This aids in overstocking and exceeding materials shelf life generating waste. It optimizes storage space and makes our 5 S program successful.  One of the most impacting programs implemented and which has provided most waste reduction results has been our LEAN program which has helped in waste reduction.

Although the generated volume for both years is similar, the actual amount of Chromium is calculated using the concentrations reported by the analytical laboratory for the metal dust samples collected each individual year. The 2011 measured Chromium concentrations were 1,222.5 micrograms/kilogram (mg/kg) or parts per million (ppm), whereas the 2012 concentrations ranged between 65 and 3,200 ppm. Consequently, the 2011 and 2012 estimated annual total amounts for Chromium vary significantly, 1,332 and 2,294 lbs, respectively (+72%). Despite the fact that the rough metal ingots were the same type and the volumes of generated metal dust were similar between both years. However, the measured concentrations for 2012 were higher.

Although the generated volume for both years is similar, the actual amount of Nickel is calculated using the concentrations reported by the analytical laboratory for the metal dust samples collected each individual year. The 2011 measured Nickel concentrations were 2,532.5 micrograms/kilogram (mg/kg) or parts per million (ppm), whereas the 2012 concentrations ranged between 120 and 11,000 ppm. Consequently, the 2011 and 2012 estimated annual total amounts for Nickel vary significantly, 2,760 and 6,302 lbs, respectively (+128%).

In the 2012 TRI Guidance Document it states ¿If a facility certifies any pending electronic submission(s) after their paper form(s) has been received and postmarked by the TRI Data Processing Center, the electronic submission(s) will be processed and will retain the postmarked date of the previously filed paper form(s).¿ Although this is in regards to not being able to electronically certify the report on-time for the July 1st deadline, this is a similar situation to that which occurred with the outage of CDX. Thank you.|PRAI: The variable used to calculate production ratio is: Nitric acid purchased.	NO	WILLIAM.CARRIGAN@ALCOA.COM			NO
