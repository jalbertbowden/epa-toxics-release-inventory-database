Reason: The 2011 reporting year shows the Batch and Continuous plants were both in operation.  The Batch plant ran for 20.7 weeks and the Continuous plant ran for 17.1 weeks for a combined totalof 38 weeks.  Both plants processed a combined total of 17252606 lb's of raw wheat germ.  The current 2012 production year shows that the Continuous plant ran only for 1.4 weeks and the Batch plant ran for 32.4 weeks.  Both plants processed a total of 13218234 lb's of raw wheat germ which is 4034372 lb's less than the previous 2011 year.  The reason for the reduction between the 2011 and 2012 reporting years was the difficulty in procuring the necessary quantities of raw wheat germ.   In addition, our out look for the 2013 reporting year is going to be about the same as the 2012 unless we are able to secure additional quantities of raw wheat germ needed.Note:  The above information and reason also applies to the other two Quality Alerts.

As such, the facility maintains a formal tagging, monitoring and data logging program. During this past year  (2012), the software company that the facility utilizes (LeakDas), issued an   updated their data logging software.  The new version applies an average emission rate, that are recorded for required component monitoring, and applies these average emission rates, to the components that are exempt from monitoring requirements or that may be on a far less frequently monitored schedule. It should also be noted that the software automatically escalates the average emissions values on an annual basis for non monitored components, This has resulted in what would appear to be a significantly inflated fugitive emissions component in this annual report.  PCCR is in the process of implementing a very extensive monitoring program to collect actual leak data, that will assist in the development of a more actual/realistic determination of potential fugitive emissions at the facility.

Acetaldehyde is produced during fermentation, and off gases are sent to a CO2 scrubber for removal of acetaldehyde. Sodium bisulfite is injected into the scrubber water to further reduce acetaldehyde emissions. Acetaldehyde within the scrubber liquid stream is recycled back to the cook water tank for use in fermentation. During fermentation, the yeast used to convert the sugar to ethyl alcohol metabolizes the acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde emissions are also generated during wet feed drying.
