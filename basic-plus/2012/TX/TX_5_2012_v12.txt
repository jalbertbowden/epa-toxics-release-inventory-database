Volumes of chemicals repackaged and transferred vary year to year based upon market demands.  Univar implements pollution prevention activities and is conscientious regarding impact to the environment.  Univar USA Inc. uses currently available methods of treatment and/or disposal for hazardous wastes, which minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment. These methods are in the treatment standards and technologies contained in the RCRA hazardous waste regulations, or are the best demonstrated available technologies (BDAT).    The following Univar USA Inc. waste minimization program applies to all wastes    managed at the facility, including wastes generated from operations on-site and    waste received into storage:    1. Personnel have been trained in procedures to reduce the creation of waste resulting from poor operational practices, such as damage during warehousing.    2. A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life.    3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customer¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life.    4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates.    5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals.    6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste.    7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging.    8. A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product.    9. A program for introducing new and innovative technology is in place to utilize equipment and develop operating practices which will reduce the amount of waste created (OSM 6.42).    10. A management team has been formed to develop methods of reducing waste generated.	NO	MARK.HESS@UNIVARUSA.COM			NO

Future: The goal of USG Sweetwater is to reduce the amount of stored waste gypsum by incorporating this material back into our process. The plant has been slated to install equipment to grind and sort the waste materials to a state that will allow it to be recovered and used in our manufacturing process. If the economy recovers this reclamation of material could be incorporated sometime in the near future.	NO	BCASON@USG.COM			YES

Personnel have been trained in procedures to reduce the creation of waste resulting from poor operational practices, such as damage during warehousing. 2. A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customer¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates. 5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste. 7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8.

The releases from this facilityinclude the following: (1) Releases to air from welding operations, which are estimated using published EPA emission factors (AP-42) and material through-puts. (2) Minor releases to landfills due to small quantities of fine metal particles becoming unavoidably entrained in plant trash (mostlyfrom floor sweepings; larger scrap metal pieces are re-used rather than disposed of). Landfill releases are estimated using conservative mass balance assumptions.

This facility is obligated to file TRI reports because the steel grades processed at this facility include chromium, manganese, and nickel.  In certain years depending on production levels, one or more of these metals may be processed in a quantity that exceeds TRI reporting thresholds. The releases from this facility include the following: (1) Minor releases to air from welding operations, which are estimated using published EPA emission factors (AP-42) and associated material through-puts. (2) Minor releases to landfills due to small quantities of fine metal particles becoming unavoidably entrained in plant trash (mostly from floor sweepings; larger scrap metal pieces are re-used rather than disposed of). Landfill releases are estimated using conservative mass balance assumptions. This facility's operations are limited to structural fabrication and the facility does not engage in any toxic chemical manufacture, surface abrasion, surface coating, or surface cleaning processes that would be expected to generate additional TRI-reportable organic or inorganic substances.

These methods are in the treatment standards and technologies contained in the RCRA hazardous waste regulations, or are the best demonstrated available technologies (BDAT). The following Univar USA Inc. waste minimization program applies to all wastes managed at the facility, including wastes generated from operations on-site and waste received into storage: 1. Personnel have been trained in procedures to reduce the creation of waste resulting from poor operational practices, such as damage during warehousing. 2. A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customerÃ¿Â¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates. 5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste. 7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8. A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product. 9. A program for introducing new and innovative technology is in place to utilize equipment and develop operating practices which will reduce the amount of waste created (OSM 6.42). 10.

The P2 Plan reduced the amount of outside law enforcement agencies using the range from approximately 7 to 1 which has helped to reduce the amount of lead being introduced into the soil at the range.  Travis County the only outside law enforcement agency authorized to use the range began using lead free ammunition whenever possible and have deciced to utilize rifle ammunition only and no longer use pistol ammunition.
