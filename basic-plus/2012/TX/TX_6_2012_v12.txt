In 2011 Flare emissions were calculated using a plant-wide material balance that uses information from several mass flowmeters located in the process units.  Currently there is no mass flowmeter on the total flare header.  Therefore, the calculations had to rely on information from several other mass flowmeters instead of one mass flow meter on the flare header.  Incoming ethylene is approximately 900 MMlbs/yr. A ±1.0% error in the material balance could correlate to a ±9 MMlbs/yr change in the ethylene balance.  This means a ±0.2% error in the material balance could result in an emissions increase or decrease of 10 TPY.  CP Chem is currently implementing a project where a new mass flowmeter is being installed on the total flare header.  Installation of this flowmeter results in more accurate estimations of emissions in future EI submittals.	NO	PRITCML@CPCHEM.COM			NO

The training provided some needed clarification and guidance to specific elements of Form R reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The most significant change to the current Form R report is that of the chemical reported itself.  After receiving training it is clear that the chemical is best reported as N420 Lead Compounds and not (elemental) Lead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Additionally, during the accounting of the maximum amount of Lead Compounds present on-site in section 4.1, a threshold-calculation assumption had been used in previous submissions.  After training this assumption has been removed, causing the range code to change from 02 to 03.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 New understanding of the definitions of ¿Manufacture¿, ¿Process¿, and ¿Otherwise-Use¿ show the previous use of the 'Import' designation is not the best way to report Lead Compounds.  This submission reflects the better reporting designation of 'Manufacture' and 'as a by-product'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Lastly, yearly disposal of solder contaminated wastes has not been recognized in previous report submissions as an off-site transfer.  This current Form R submission has added this transfer appropriately in sections 6.2 and 8.1d.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Xytronics', good practices in handling Lead Compounds continue this year, as in previous years, where approximately .03% is released, 1.4% is properly disposed of and 98.6% of our chemical is recycled annually.
