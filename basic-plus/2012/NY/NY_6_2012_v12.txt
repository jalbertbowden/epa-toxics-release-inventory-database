The majority of this production-related waste comes in the form of dross and paste as by-products of our solder processes.  These materials are sent to an approved vendor for metals recovery.  Among the reasoned causes for the percentage change are increased chemical use (as a result of increased production demand) and more frequent preventative maintenance on the source equipment (which increased the frequency of solder pot surface contact with air, resulting in increased dross production).  It is anticipated that an equipment upgrade scheduled for 2013 will decrease overall dross production, and thereby decrease the amount of production-related waste for this chemical.

Note this Facility has submitted a self disclosure for the recent discovery (June 2013) of TRI reporting. In 2009 and 2010 thee facility exceeded reporting thresholds for lead and lead compounds; however, the waste was not disposed of until 2011 so there were no releases. The lead comes from lead tetra oxide found in the epoxy used for molding. Note per the MSDS this epoxy is not volatile. PPE used during the molding process as well as waste molding is properly disposed of hazardous waste. This waste is stabilized. The facilty also uses lead sheets that are article exempt; however, in 2011 an R&D process began that required a few lead sheets to be cut which is not exempt.
