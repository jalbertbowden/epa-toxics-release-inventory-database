The high pressure feed water heater on Unit 4 was also re-tubed which results in an improved heat rate (mmBtu/kw) of the boiler operation to reduce the amount of coal burned.

The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank (fermenter) for about 3 days.  While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars.  During this time propagated dry batch yeast cells are added to the fermenter.  The hydrated yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide gas.  Formaldehyde is a byproduct of fermentation.  The formaldehyde becomes entrained in the gas stream leaving the fermenter.  This gas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied in a carbon dioxide purification plant.  The water flow rate on the wet scrubber is controlled to maintain compliance with environmental regulations based on emissions stack testing data.Formaldehyde is produced in an intermediate reaction in the combustion of natural gas.  POET Preston has two steam boilers capable of firing natural gas, two dryers with one natural gas burner each, and an RTO with three natural gas burners.	NO	RICHARD.EICHSTADT@POET.COM			NO

The issue was first identified in 2011 and a team was assembled to comprehensively evaluate each process for water use needs, actual usage and the resulting discharge to POTW.  It was determined that the majority of categorical process waste water could be effectively cleaned an reused.  Various systems were evaluated/considered and ultimately a centrifuge unit was purchased and installed in 2012.  Since installation, the facility has reached near zero discharge status.  The facility now qualities for an Insignificant Categorical User Permit (<100 gpd) with the local POTW (MCES).|W66:Minneapolis Die Casting initiated a capital improvement project to reduce water consumption and resulting industrial discharge to the POTW.

This was due to entirely to customer demand of the same types of mercury switch products as the 2011 and previous reporting years.In the reporting year 2010, a new non-mercury liquid level sensing product was release to the market which has the capacity to replace up to 4 float switches (in a given application).  These float switches could be mercury based switches.  This non-mercury liquid level sensing product also works in conjunction with a control panel. For the reporting year 2012, we have released to the market a similar non-mercury liquid level sensing product but has 2.5 times operating range so it can be used in more applications than the non-mercury sensing product SJE-Rhombus released in 2011.  We also offer different types of control panels that work with this new (higher-range) liquid level sensor to fit different types of liquid level control applications.  This additional sensor device will enhance the reduction of mercury based float sales.  On going, new applications are being developed with this new non-mercury liquid level sensor.
