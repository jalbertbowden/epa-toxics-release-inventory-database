STP worked with Safety-Kleen Systems to determine the feasibility of this option.  This option is not feasible at this time because the recycled solvent that would be returned to STP could contain additional solvents other than stoddard solvent in concentrations less than 1%.   The additional solvents could affect Employee health and product quality.   In August of 2012, STP purchased a distillation machine to reclaim the stoddard solvent for reuse on site.  The distillation machine was in full production beginning in October 2012.  Preliminary data indicates that we are disposing of less spent stoddard solvent off-site as hazardous waste.  Some spent stoddard solvent cannot be recycled due to high amounts of suspended solids, oil and grease.  STP will continue to dispose of stoddard solvent that cannot be recycled (due to large amounts of impurities) and the waste still bottoms from the distillation machine as hazardous waste.    STP will continue to improve the efficiency of the distillation process in 2013.     STRAIGHT LENGTH TUBE DRAWING (OD, ID REDUCTION) ÿ¿ CHANGE FROM ANIMAL FAT BASED LUBRICANT TO PETROLEUM BASED LUBRICANT.  In 2012, continued experiments to determine if quality straight length tubing can be drawn using petroleum based lubricants versus an animal fat based lubricant.  The animal fat based lubricant is not recycled or burned for energy recovery; it is treated and disposed of as residual waste.  STP currently uses petroleum based lubricants to draw tubing in coil form.  These spent petroleum based lubricants are shipped off-site to waste oil disposal locations to be recycled or burned for energy recovery. Eliminating animal fat based lubricants would allow STP to ship nearly all lubricants off site to be recycled or burned for energy recovery.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2013.

STP worked with Safety-Kleen Systems to determine the feasibility of this option.  This option is not feasible at this time because the recycled solvent that would be returned to STP could contain additional solvents other than stoddard solvent in concentrations less than 1%.   The additional solvents could affect Employee health and product quality.   In August of 2012, STP purchased a distillation machine to reclaim the stoddard solvent for reuse on site.  The distillation machine was in full production beginning in October 2012.  Preliminary data indicates that we are disposing of less spent stoddard solvent off-site as hazardous waste.  Some spent stoddard solvent cannot be recycled due to high amounts of suspended solids, oil and grease.  STP will continue to dispose of stoddard solvent that cannot be recycled (due to large amounts of impurities) and the waste still bottoms from the distillation machine as hazardous waste.

STRAIGHT LENGTH TUBE DRAWING (OD, ID REDUCTION)  CHANGE FROM ANIMAL FAT BASED LUBRICANT TO PETROLEUM BASED LUBRICANT.  In 2012, continued experiments to determine if quality straight length tubing can be drawn using petroleum based lubricants versus an animal fat based lubricant.  The animal fat based lubricant is not recycled or burned for energy recovery; it is treated and disposed of as residual waste.  STP currently uses petroleum based lubricants to draw tubing in coil form.  These spent petroleum based lubricants are shipped off-site to waste oil disposal locations to be recycled or burned for energy recovery. Eliminating animal fat based lubricants would allow STP to ship nearly all lubricants off site to be recycled or burned for energy recovery.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2013.

STP worked with Safety-Kleen Systems to determine the feasibility of this option.  This option is not feasible at this time because the recycled solvent that would be returned to STP could contain additional solvents other than stoddard solvent in concentrations less than 1%.   The additional solvents could affect Employee health and product quality.   In August of 2012, STP purchased a distillation machine to reclaim the stoddard solvent for reuse on site.  The distillation machine was in full production beginning in October 2012.  Preliminary data indicates that we are disposing of less spent stoddard solvent off-site as hazardous waste.  Some spent stoddard solvent cannot be recycled due to high amounts of suspended solids, oil and grease.  STP will continue to dispose of stoddard solvent that cannot be recycled (due to large amounts of impurities) and the waste still bottoms from the distillation machine as hazardous waste.    STP will continue to improve the efficiency of the distillation process in 2013.     STRAIGHT LENGTH TUBE DRAWING (OD, ID REDUCTION) ¿ CHANGE FROM ANIMAL FAT BASED LUBRICANT TO PETROLEUM BASED LUBRICANT.  In 2012, continued experiments to determine if quality straight length tubing can be drawn using petroleum based lubricants versus an animal fat based lubricant.  The animal fat based lubricant is not recycled or burned for energy recovery; it is treated and disposed of as residual waste.  STP currently uses petroleum based lubricants to draw tubing in coil form.  These spent petroleum based lubricants are shipped off-site to waste oil disposal locations to be recycled or burned for energy recovery. Eliminating animal fat based lubricants would allow STP to ship nearly all lubricants off site to be recycled or burned for energy recovery.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2013.
