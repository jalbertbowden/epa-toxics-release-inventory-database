STP worked with Safety-Kleen Systems to determine the feasibility of this option.  This option is not feasible at this time because the recycled solvent that would be returned to STP could contain additional solvents other than stoddard solvent in concentrations less than 1%.   The additional solvents could affect Employee health and product quality.   In August of 2012, STP purchased a distillation machine to reclaim the stoddard solvent for reuse on site.  The distillation machine was in full production beginning in October 2012.  Preliminary data indicates that we are disposing of less spent stoddard solvent off-site as hazardous waste.  Some spent stoddard solvent cannot be recycled due to high amounts of suspended solids, oil and grease.  STP will continue to dispose of stoddard solvent that cannot be recycled (due to large amounts of impurities) and the waste still bottoms from the distillation machine as hazardous waste.    STP will continue to improve the efficiency of the distillation process in 2013.     STRAIGHT LENGTH TUBE DRAWING (OD, ID REDUCTION) Â¿ CHANGE FROM ANIMAL FAT BASED LUBRICANT TO PETROLEUM BASED LUBRICANT.  In 2012, continued experiments to determine if quality straight length tubing can be drawn using petroleum based lubricants versus an animal fat based lubricant.  The animal fat based lubricant is not recycled or burned for energy recovery; it is treated and disposed of as residual waste.  STP currently uses petroleum based lubricants to draw tubing in coil form.  These spent petroleum based lubricants are shipped off-site to waste oil disposal locations to be recycled or burned for energy recovery. Eliminating animal fat based lubricants would allow STP to ship nearly all lubricants off site to be recycled or burned for energy recovery.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2013.

However, since some waste from daily operations went to landfill in the earlier part of 2012, TRI reports for the 2012 Reporting Year may show some constituents disposed to landfill. In addition, event waste (from one-time events, not associated with the daily, productive operations of the facility) may still be disposed via landfill if this is the only technical or economically feasible option.  Such event waste may be reportable on the TRI report, but does not negate the landfill-free status of the facility, as that status is from daily operations.  Waste from construction & demolition projects and environmental remediation are examples of event waste.   For more information on GMs Landfill-Free initiative, see "The Business Case for Zero Waste" (http://media.gm.com/content/dam/Media/documents/US/Word/101912-Landfill-free-blueprint.docx).  This downloadable blueprint is intended to help companies of all sizes and industries reduce waste and create efficiencies.

Personnel have been trained in procedures to reduce the creation of waste resulting from poor operational practices, such as damage during warehousing. 2. A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customer¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates. 5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste. 7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8. A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product. 9. A program for introducing new and innovative technology is in place to utilize equipment and develop operating practices which will reduce the amount of waste created (OSM 6.42). 10.

This part of the facility was constructed much more recently and therefore utilizes 100% capture to treat the emissions prior to the release.  In this area we are reducing emissions of ozone from what is naturally created during our production process.|SRNA:The corna treaters treat the film based on jobs that require "treated" film.  As the customers request more jobs and higher quantities of jobs with treated film, we utilize the corna treaters more often.  When this happens the amount of ozone produced increases.  The only way to reduce these fugitive emissions is to create an complete enclosure and utilize some sort of source reduction equipment for our film production equipment.  With the machines spread out throughout the entire facility, and the size of the plant being so large, such a enclosure is almost imposible in the current building we have.  Considering the building we use is over 50 years old, and is not designed for such an enclosure, insufficient capital would be our primary issue to not being able to control the quantity of this source.

Chemical-Specific Information (Barium Compounds) Apollo Colors Inc. uses Barium Chloride for specific Chemical Process Reactions.  The excess/residual Barium salts in all wastewater from reactions are pretreated to Barium Sulfate.  The Barium Sulfate is removed (filtered) from the the wastewater.  The Barium Sulfate (Filtrate) is sent to a Non-Hazardous Landfill.  The filtered wastewater is sent to the local POTW. With the delisting of Barium Sulfate as a reportable Hazardous Substance in 1995 by the U. S. EPA,  Apollo Colors Inc.  has eliminated reporting in Section 6.2  TRANSFERS TO OTHER OFF-SITE LOCATIONS.However,  Apollo Colors Inc. continues to report in Section 6.1 DISCHARGES TO PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW) because the local POTW does not differentiate between different kinds of Barium in the wastewater - POTW  permits are based on Total Barium.|SRNA:Although production increased in 2012 the amount of barium sulfate sent to the landfill decreased. This decrease can be attributed to the product codes that were produced had reduced barium excess, 31% excess in 2011 vs. 21.4% excess in 2012.	NO	BWRIGHT@APOLLOCOLORS.COM			YES

However, since some waste from daily operations went to landfill in the earlier part of 2012, TRI reports for the 2012 Reporting Year may show some constituents disposed to landfill. In addition, event waste (from one-time events, not associated with the daily, productive operations of the facility) may still be disposed via landfill if this is the only technical or economically feasible option.  Such event waste may be reportable on the TRI report, but does not negate the landfill-free status of the facility, as that status is from daily operations.  Waste from construction & demolition projects and environmental remediation are examples of event waste.   For more information on GMs Landfill-Free initiative, see "The Business Case for Zero Waste" (http://media.gm.com/content/dam/Media/documents/US/Word/101912-Landfill-free-blueprint.docx).

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.  Per contract with DTI's customers, DTI does not own the process technology and is limited in its ability to substitute chemicals or modify the process.	NO	PBACON@DANCHEM.COM			NO

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.  Per contract with DTI's customers, DTI does not own the process technology and is limited in its ability to substitute chemicals or modify the process.	NO	PBACON@DANCHEM.COM			NO

Neither the toluene nor the xylene is consumed in the process. The spray room exhaust contains organic vapors and particulate matter. Most of the toluene and xylene leave the spray room as vapor, but a miniscule amount adsorbs onto the surface of the dust particles. The exhaust enters two baghouses. The baghouses filter out most of the particulate matter, which is collected in drums. A small amount of toluene and xylene remain adsorbed onto the collected "baghouse dust" This toluene and xylene (less than 1 pound per year) goes along with the baghouse dust to an off-site disposal facility. The rest of the toluene and xylene leave the baghouses as (mainly) vapor and as adsorbate on the very fine particles that pass through the baghouse filters. The toluene and xylene vapors and the very fine toluene- and xylene-bearing particles enter a regenerative thermal oxidizer, which converts the toluene and xylene to carbon dioxide and water. A tiny fraction (0.80 percent) of the toluene and xylene is not oxidized and is released as a point source emission to the atmosphere.	NO	MARKR@STEWARTFILMSCREEN.COM			NO

Training at the CATM Range is driven by base security requirements and the deployment of base personnel to overseas combat theaters.  With the withdrawal of U.S. Forces from Iraq and their anticipated withdrawal from Afghanistan, it is anticipated that the level of training at the CATM Range will decrease to some extent, and this will reduce the amount of ammunition containing lead that is expended.  Vandenberg AFB is still actively pursuing a larger allocation of so-called "green bullets" that contain less lead, but still satisfy training requirements.|W29:Vandenberg AFB has revitalized its Green Product Procurement program to ensure Base Supply procures the most environmentally friendly commodities commensurate with mission requirements.|T01:Using EPA and GSA listings of "Green Preferred Products," each order for a hazardous material submitted to Base Supply is scrutinized to verify whether a more environmentally friendly substitute is available.

A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customer¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates. 5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste. 7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8. A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product. 9. A program for introducing new and innovative technology is in place to utilize equipment and develop operating practices which will reduce the amount of waste created (OSM 6.42). 10.

In addition Channel has implemented use of a special drum lift tool that attaches to the forklift to reduce the potential for spills when moving these drums from pallets into a water bath for heating. Acetophenone is shipped to the plant in metal drums by tractor trailer and stored in a future warehouse area.  Potential losses could occur during charging of the chemical to reactors (from drums), either from vapors as the drums are opened, or from drips that may occur during connection and disconnection of pumps and hoses. Both types of losses are very minimal. Occasional heavy rainwater flow will pick up residue from process areas, but it is contained within protective dikes.  Acetophenone is present in a process water that is sent offsite to a waste disposal company. In addition, empty acetophenone drums that contain a small amount of residue are stored until they are picked up by a drum recycling company and taken offsite.|W32:Channel Chemical bought a drum-lifting attachment for the forklift that allows an operator to safely lift drums of acetophenone into and out of the hot water bath.

STP worked with Safety-Kleen Systems to determine the feasibility of this option.  This option is not feasible at this time because the recycled solvent that would be returned to STP could contain additional solvents other than stoddard solvent in concentrations less than 1%.   The additional solvents could affect Employee health and product quality.   In August of 2012, STP purchased a distillation machine to reclaim the stoddard solvent for reuse on site.  The distillation machine was in full production beginning in October 2012.  Preliminary data indicates that we are disposing of less spent stoddard solvent off-site as hazardous waste.  Some spent stoddard solvent cannot be recycled due to high amounts of suspended solids, oil and grease.  STP will continue to dispose of stoddard solvent that cannot be recycled (due to large amounts of impurities) and the waste still bottoms from the distillation machine as hazardous waste.    STP will continue to improve the efficiency of the distillation process in 2013.     STRAIGHT LENGTH TUBE DRAWING (OD, ID REDUCTION) ¿ CHANGE FROM ANIMAL FAT BASED LUBRICANT TO PETROLEUM BASED LUBRICANT.  In 2012, continued experiments to determine if quality straight length tubing can be drawn using petroleum based lubricants versus an animal fat based lubricant.  The animal fat based lubricant is not recycled or burned for energy recovery; it is treated and disposed of as residual waste.  STP currently uses petroleum based lubricants to draw tubing in coil form.  These spent petroleum based lubricants are shipped off-site to waste oil disposal locations to be recycled or burned for energy recovery. Eliminating animal fat based lubricants would allow STP to ship nearly all lubricants off site to be recycled or burned for energy recovery.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2013.

According to the MSDS supplied by Ecolab, Inc., AC-55-5 Red contains 38% nitric acid by weight and Passivation Acid contains 23% nitric acid by weight. These chemicals are used to clean process tanks and vessels then discharged to a 21,352-gallon onsite wastewater equalization tank. The wastewater is pH neutralized in the tank through active chemical addition and then batch discharged to the Concord Wastewater Treatment Facility three to four times each production day. Use of the sanitizing agents and neutralization in the wastewater equalization tank dissociates the nitric acid into nitrate compounds and it is assumed that all of the nitric acid is treated onsite. However, there is a possibility that trace amounts of nitric acid are discharged to the POTW for treatment. Based on the quantities of nitric acid used, we calculate that HP Hood produced approximately 15,150 lbs of NaNO3 onsite during calendar year 2013, which is below the 25,000 lb threshold for manufacture. HP Hood is actively working with Ecolab to purchase sanitizing chemicals with lower concentrations of toxic chemicals.	NO	MICHAEL.ANDERSON@HPHOOD.COM			NO

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

However, since some waste from daily operations went to landfill in the earlier part of 2012, TRI reports for the 2012 Reporting Year may show some constituents disposed to landfill. In addition, event waste (from one-time events, not associated with the daily, productive operations of the facility) may still be disposed via landfill if this is the only technical or economically feasible option.  Such event waste may be reportable on the TRI report, but does not negate the landfill-free status of the facility, as that status is from daily operations.  Waste from construction & demolition projects and environmental remediation are examples of event waste.   For more information on GMs Landfill-Free initiative, see "The Business Case for Zero Waste" (http://media.gm.com/content/dam/Media/documents/US/Word/101912-Landfill-free-blueprint.docx).  This downloadable blueprint is intended to help companies of all sizes and industries reduce waste and create efficiencies. For more information on GMs environmental commitment, visit its sustainability report (http://www.gmsustainability.com/) and environmental blog (http://www.gmbeyondnow.com/).|W58:In 2011, we changed the customer that a certain scrap metal by-product stream was sold to.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

However, since some waste from daily operations went to landfill in the earlier part of 2012, TRI reports for the 2012 Reporting Year may show some constituents disposed to landfill. In addition, event waste (from one-time events, not associated with the daily, productive operations of the facility) may still be disposed via landfill if this is the only technical or economically feasible option.  Such event waste may be reportable on the TRI report, but does not negate the landfill-free status of the facility, as that status is from daily operations.  Waste from construction & demolition projects and environmental remediation are examples of event waste.   For more information on GMs Landfill-Free initiative, see "The Business Case for Zero Waste" (http://media.gm.com/content/dam/Media/documents/US/Word/101912-Landfill-free-blueprint.docx).

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the siteÂ¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.  Per contract with DTI's customers, DTI does not own the process technology and is limited in its ability to substitute chemicals or modify the process.	NO	PBACON@DANCHEM.COM			NO

The Humble facility is obligated to file TRI reports because the carbon steel grades processed at this facility include approximately 1% Manganese plus or minus other reportable trace metal components. The releases from this facilityinclude the following: (1) Releases to air from welding operations, which are estimated using published EPA emission factors (AP-42) and material through-puts. (2) Minor releases to landfills due to small quantities of fine metal particles becoming unavoidably entrained in plant trash (mostlyfrom floor sweepings; larger scrap metal pieces are re-used rather than disposed of). Landfill releases are estimated using conservative mass balance assumptions. This facility's operations are limited to structural fabrication and the facility does not engage in any surface abrasion, surface coating, or surface cleaning processes that would be expected to generate additional TRI-reportable organic or inorganic substances.

Fly ash reduces the quantity of cement needed to produce a yard of concrete. Benefits: Use of fly ash reduces the quantity of cement needed to produce a given volume of ready-mix concrete mixture. This result in a smaller quantity of lead for a given volume of concrete only when fly ash lead concentrations are lower than those found in cement.Obstacles: Fly ash contains similar lead concentrations as cement. Therefore, fly ash use will not significantly reduce the lead concentration in the ready-mix product. Higher fly ash concentrations increase curing time affecting the product¿s value to customers. Fly ash sources are limited and variable. Market forces affect availability.2012 Update: In 2012 Preferred Concrete obtained permission by the Town of Freetown to transport fly ash within the limits of the Town, a practice that was previously prohibited by the Town. As a result, Preferred is considering for future application use of fly ash in its ready mix concrete formulations. Fly ash is a byproduct of coal combustion. Energy production from combustion of coal has diminished recently due to the cost, availability, and use of natural gas. This, coupled with the recent shortage of fly ash from power plant shut downs has reduced the availability and increased the cost of fly ash in Massachusetts. Preferred continues to investigate this option and will implement it if and when it makes good business sense.	NO	PREFERREDSUE@AOL.COM			YES

This is as a result of calculating emissions differently.  Previsously, emissions were calculated using an emission factor for wire welding for the entire wire.  In fusing, only a small percentage of the wire used is melted, so the amount of wire was divided by 100 (assuming 1% of wire is actually fused, the rest is wrapped around the stator).

This Oxygen at high temperature reacts with the charge to form Oxides of Crome,Cobalt etc in the form of slag. It also creates Oxide effluent gas which goes in the air. SPAL process uses liquid Argon which being heavier forms a blanket over the molten metal in the furnace.Liquid Argon epands 800 times and it pushes the air(Oxygen) out of the furnace. We have implemented SPAL ( Surface Protection Air Liquide) in our melting practice,the Oxygen level over the molten bath is reduced from 20.9% to 2 %.This also reduces the slag by 75% and also reduces considerably the oxide effluent gas.

A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customer¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates. 5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste. 7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8. A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product. 9.

Ammonia is injected in a selective catalytic reactor (SCR). Prior to the injection of ammonia, water vapor is injected to attain certain levels of NOx. After the maximum reduction of NOx is achieved through water vapor injection, ammonia is injected to reduce them to reach applicable regulatory levels. The formal project included: an analysis of ammonia injection throughout a base year; identification of periods for which ammonia injection could be controlled further, replacement of old ammonia injection control valves for new ones which improved the response time between load changes in the combustion turbines and the fine tuning of water vapor injection to increase to a maximum the NOx reduction occurring before ammonia injection.  An approximate reduction of 15% of ammonia usage was attained with the project implementation.|W58:The manufacturer of the combustion turbines for which ammonia is used to reduce NOx emissions to comply with applicable regulations, completed a fine tunning of water vapor injection  which is used to reduce NOx emissions prior to ammonia inject|T06:Throughout the project implementation, representatives from the operations and maintenance departments participated in support to the environmental department which was leading the effort.|T01:A formal assessment of ammonia usage was completed.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank (fermenter) for about 3 days.  While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars.  During this time propagated dry batch yeast cells are added to the fermenter.  The hydrated yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide gas.  Formaldehyde is a byproduct of fermentation.  The formaldehyde becomes entrained in the gas stream leaving the fermenter.  This gas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied in a carbon dioxide purification plant.  The water flow rate on the wet scrubber is controlled to maintain compliance with environmental regulations based on emissions stack testing data.Formaldehyde is produced in an intermediate reaction in the combustion of natural gas.

When the wooden baffles, impregnated with lead from the firing of rounds, need replacing, the weight totals for lead waste debris increase significantly due to the weight of the wood.|SRNA:Pollution prevention previously implemented - additional reduction does not appear technically or economically feasible. All of the lead waste and lead releases are generated at the Base Portsmouth outdoor small arms firing range. Pollution prevention procedures are closely followed to minimize the lead concentrations in the stormwater discharges and there is no way feasible to capture fugitive emmissions at an outdoor firing range. The only way to improve the pollution prevention capabilities would be to construct an indoor firing range which would eliminate lead being discharged into the stormwater discharges and it would also eliminate fugitive emmissions from the firing of rounds. Unfortunately, at this time, constructing an indoor firing range is not economically feasible.	YES	GENE.C.LEONARD@USCG.MIL			YES

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

There is an increased use of sulfuryl fluoride from RY2011 to RY2012, because the warehouse was included in the facility general fumigation, which is not standard protocol.  Standard fumigations typically only includes the mill department.  In additional to the implementation of an integrated pest management process (deep cleaning), work practices will be implemented to reduce the need for warehouse fumigations.|SRNA:This chemical is used for the control of inscects in our flour milling process as a general fumigant.  We are implementing cleaning and sanitation activities (Insect Pest Management) that consists of scheduled production down days for deep cleaning of equipment in our process that will result in less use of fumigants to control the insects.  The process will reduce chemical use, but will not eliminate it.  Additionally, we previously used Methyl Bromide, but have transitioned to Profume or sulfuryl fluoride.

This facility is obligated to file TRI reports because the steel grades processed at this facility include chromium, manganese, and nickel.  In certain years depending on production levels, one or more of these metals may be processed in a quantity that exceeds TRI reporting thresholds. The releases from this facility include the following: (1) Minor releases to air from welding operations, which are estimated using published EPA emission factors (AP-42) and associated material through-puts. (2) Minor releases to landfills due to small quantities of fine metal particles becoming unavoidably entrained in plant trash (mostly from floor sweepings; larger scrap metal pieces are re-used rather than disposed of). Landfill releases are estimated using conservative mass balance assumptions. This facility's operations are limited to structural fabrication and the facility does not engage in any toxic chemical manufacture, surface abrasion, surface coating, or surface cleaning processes that would be expected to generate additional TRI-reportable organic or inorganic substances.

These methods are in the treatment standards and technologies contained in the RCRA hazardous waste regulations, or are the best demonstrated available technologies (BDAT). The following Univar USA Inc. waste minimization program applies to all wastes managed at the facility, including wastes generated from operations on-site and waste received into storage: 1. Personnel have been trained in procedures to reduce the creation of waste resulting from poor operational practices, such as damage during warehousing. 2. A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customer¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates. 5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste. 7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8. A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product. 9. A program for introducing new and innovative technology is in place to utilize equipment and develop operating practices which will reduce the amount of waste created (OSM 6.42). 10.

The project was completed in 2 phases.  1.  Optimization of process parameters and stricter operational control.  2.  Hardware upgrade.   Site also used third parties to calibrate all air flow for stacks to get accurate data and better calculate the emissions. As a result, site achieved significant reduction in emissions.  Economic downturn as well as change in product portfolio has also helped the cause significantly.  There is a conscious effort to move to water based products portfolio from a VOC based (solvent borne) product portfolio.	NO	BEN.HOPKINS@DSM.COM			NO

Since we are custom assembly manufacture, and we do not design the products we build, we must rely on our customers to design out the use of leaded solders. Many of our customers are medical, defense and aerospace, which currently have exemptions in the use of lead-free solders. These exemptions will be expired in the 12 - 24 months, so we anticipate our customers redesigning their products, using lead-free solders.

Between the melting and critical points, liquid ammonia exerts a vapor pressure, which increases with rising temperature. When liquid ammonia is in a solid container, it is in equilibrium with ammonia vapor and the pressure within the container bears a definite relationship to the temperature.

The process at Woodworth Inc., involves ammonia being introduced into the furnaces as a vapor. The nitrogen is diffused into the surface layer of the metal and the hydrogen is exhausted to the furnace burn-off stack, where it is mixed with natural gas and it is ignited by a pyrotechnic device to insure complete combustion.

We anticipate that we will not need to perform this task in the upcoming years therefore zinc waste is anticipated to decrease back to levels that we had experienced in previous years.  Two other reasons for zinc being higher in 2012 are below; The increase in the amount of zinc compared to previous years is attributed to scrapping impounded production material from prior years.  This caused the amount of scrap metal sent for recycling to increase. Additionally, we scrapped approximately 60 pieces of production machinery that was sent for metal recycling.  This also resulted in an increase of the amount of scrap metal that was sent for recycling in 2012.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the siteÂ¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

This was due to entirely to customer demand of the same types of mercury switch products as the 2011 and previous reporting years.In the reporting year 2010, a new non-mercury liquid level sensing product was release to the market which has the capacity to replace up to 4 float switches (in a given application).  These float switches could be mercury based switches.  This non-mercury liquid level sensing product also works in conjunction with a control panel. For the reporting year 2012, we have released to the market a similar non-mercury liquid level sensing product but has 2.5 times operating range so it can be used in more applications than the non-mercury sensing product SJE-Rhombus released in 2011.  We also offer different types of control panels that work with this new (higher-range) liquid level sensor to fit different types of liquid level control applications.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the siteÂ¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

It is highly regulated and the chloroform can only be used once.  This is a closed loop system with zero emissions to air and 100% of the chloroform used is transported off-site as hazardous waste for incineration. DePuy is researching options for a process that will permit a single re-use of the chloroform, which would halve the amount required at present production volumes.  There may be growth in this sector, so the goal is to minimize the use of chloroform while maximizing the production of this product.

Neither the toluene nor the xylene is consumed in the process. The spray room exhaust contains organic vapors and particulate matter. Most of the toluene and xylene leave the spray room as vapor, but a miniscule amount adsorbs onto the surface of the dust particles. The exhaust enters two baghouses. The baghouses filter out most of the particulate matter, which is collected in drums. A small amount of toluene and xylene remain adsorbed onto the collected "baghouse dust." This toluene and xylene (less than 1 pound per year) goes along with the baghouse dust to an off-site disposal facility. The rest of the toluene and xylene leave the baghouses as (mainly) vapor and as adsorbate on the very fine particles that pass through the baghouse filters. The toluene and xylene vapors and the very fine toluene- and xylene-bearing particles enter a regenerative thermal oxidizer, which converts the toluene and xylene to carbon dioxide and water. A tiny fraction (0.80 percent) of the toluene and xylene is not oxidized and is released as a point source emission to the atmosphere.	NO	MARKR@STEWARTFILMSCREEN.COM			NO

Volumes of chemicals repackaged and transferred vary year to year based upon market demands.  Univar implements pollution prevention activities and is conscientious regarding impact to the environment.  Univar USA Inc. uses currently available methods of treatment and/or disposal for hazardous wastes, which minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment. These methods are in the treatment standards and technologies contained in the RCRA hazardous waste regulations, or are the best demonstrated available technologies (BDAT). The following Univar USA Inc. waste minimization program applies to all wastes managed at the facility, including wastes generated from operations on-site and waste received into storage: 1. Personnel have been trained in procedures to reduce the creation of waste resulting from poor operational practices, such as damage during warehousing. 2. A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventory from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3. A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service our customerÃ¿Â¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4. A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf-life dates. 5. A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6. A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create line flush waste. 7. A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8. A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product. 9. A program for introducing new and innovative technology is in place to utilize equipment and develop operating practices which will reduce the amount of waste created (OSM 6.42). 10. A management team has been formed to develop methods of reducing waste generated.|T11:Removed Bulk Methanol Storage tank from service.	NO	GAIL.BACKUS@UNIVAR.COM			NO

The Environmental and Safety Compliance Department developed an excel spread sheet to monitor the amount of lead and air emissions that occur while the range is used.  The P2 Plan reduced the amount of outside law enforcement agencies using the range from approximately 7 to 1 which has helped to reduce the amount of lead being introduced into the soil at the range.  Travis County the only outside law enforcement agency authorized to use the range began using lead free ammunition whenever possible and have deciced to utilize rifle ammunition only and no longer use pistol ammunition.  FCI Bastrop due to agency regulations at this time lead free ammunition cannot be used.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.

The basin was a lined surface impoundment designed to collect high pH wastewater from areas of the site and mix with low pH wastewater from other areas of the site in an attempt to neutralize prior to discharge to the City of Danville Wastewater Treatment Facility.  Operation of the system was regulated under an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit which required continuous monitoring for pH and periodic monitoring for concentrations of chemical contamination.   Although there were no regulatory mandates which forced the elimination of the effluent basin, in August 2011, DTI voluntarily began the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility to completely eliminate the effluent basin and start utilizing the latest technologies in wastewater treatment and pollution prevention.  In August 2012, one year following the start of the project, all wastewater from across the site was being pumped through an above ground piping system and was being accumulated in a series of storage tanks within the  secondary containment of the new wastewater tank farm.  By the end of 2012, the new wastewater treatment facility went operational and began treating the site¿s discharge.  DTI is currently exploring opportunities to reuse the discharge from the wastewater treatment facility.|SRNA:DanChem Technologies (DTI) is a custom or toll chemical manufacturer producing materials on behalf of other chemical manufacturers following their prescribed formulations and processes.  Per contract with DTI's customers, DTI does not own the process technology and is limited in its ability to substitute chemicals or modify the process.	NO	PBACON@DANCHEM.COM			NO

STP worked with Safety-Kleen Systems to determine the feasibility of this option.  This option is not feasible at this time because the recycled solvent that would be returned to STP could contain additional solvents other than stoddard solvent in concentrations less than 1%.   The additional solvents could affect Employee health and product quality.   In August of 2012, STP purchased a distillation machine to reclaim the stoddard solvent for reuse on site.  The distillation machine was in full production beginning in October 2012.  Preliminary data indicates that we are disposing of less spent stoddard solvent off-site as hazardous waste.  Some spent stoddard solvent cannot be recycled due to high amounts of suspended solids, oil and grease.  STP will continue to dispose of stoddard solvent that cannot be recycled (due to large amounts of impurities) and the waste still bottoms from the distillation machine as hazardous waste.    STP will continue to improve the efficiency of the distillation process in 2013.     STRAIGHT LENGTH TUBE DRAWING (OD, ID REDUCTION) Ã¿Â¿ CHANGE FROM ANIMAL FAT BASED LUBRICANT TO PETROLEUM BASED LUBRICANT.  In 2012, continued experiments to determine if quality straight length tubing can be drawn using petroleum based lubricants versus an animal fat based lubricant.  The animal fat based lubricant is not recycled or burned for energy recovery; it is treated and disposed of as residual waste.  STP currently uses petroleum based lubricants to draw tubing in coil form.  These spent petroleum based lubricants are shipped off-site to waste oil disposal locations to be recycled or burned for energy recovery. Eliminating animal fat based lubricants would allow STP to ship nearly all lubricants off site to be recycled or burned for energy recovery.  This project will continue to be investigated in 2013.
