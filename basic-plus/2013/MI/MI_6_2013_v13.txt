Lost molding sand previously was replaced with 100% new raw molding sand.  We were using approximately 200 pounds per day of new raw molding sand.  We are now storing more of our "waste" sand and are now mixing approximately 50 pounds of new raw sand with approximately 150 pounds of previously wasted sand.
