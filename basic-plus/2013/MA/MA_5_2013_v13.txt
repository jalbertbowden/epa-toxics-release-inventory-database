Priming of Film Products ¿ Testing has been conducted by outside vendors and internally in order to use Coater #6 to prime some of our film products.  These products were originally being primed on Coater #5, an uncontrolled unit.  This has helped reduce uncontrolled emissions as Coater #5 remained unused for the entirety of 2013. 2.Lowering of Coat Weights¿ Trials have been conducted to evaluate the possibility of reducing the overall amount of adhesive applied (and potential emissions) to several of our product lines.  These tests will continue in order to verify the impact on our products.3.Increase Solids Content of Adhesives¿ Evaluations of adhesives have been performed, and where practical, the solids content has been increased.  This allows for a reduction in the amount of solvent used.  4.Replacement of Solvent-based Fabric Finish with Water-based Fabric Finish - Progress continues in replacing several of our current solvent-based release coats with a water-based system.|W49:Research and development department continues to pursue increasing solids content in adhesive formulations and the lowering of coat weights.

The cement used by Tresca contains approximately 5 parts per million (ppm) lead, as a naturally occurring trace element. Fly ash used by Tresca contains approximately 16 ppm lead. Fly ash is a by-product of coal-fired electric generating plants. Thirty percent of the fly ash in the United States is recycled into making concrete. The use of these byproducts offers environmental advantages by diverting the material from the waste stream, reducing the energy investment in processing virgin materials, conserving virgin materials, and allaying pollution. Although fly ash offers environmental advantages, it also improves the performance and quality of concrete. Fly ash affects the plastic properties of concrete by improving workability, reducing water demand, reducing segregation and bleeding, and lowering heat of hydration. Fly ash increases strength, reduces permeability, reduces corrosion of reinforcing steel, increases sulphate resistance, and reduces alkali-aggregate reaction. Concrete made with fly ash reaches its maximum strength more slowly than concrete made with only Portland cement.	NO	FDR1481@AOL.COM			YES
