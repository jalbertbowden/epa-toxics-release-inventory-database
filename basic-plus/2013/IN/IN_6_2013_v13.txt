Structural & Rail Division (SDI) appreciates USEPA¿s inquiry into the accuracy of the reported total air releases of mercury for 2013.  Upon further review, SDI has discovered that in calculating 2013 mercury air emissions, it inadvertently used the most recent stack test emission factor for lead rather than the most recent stack test emission factor for mercury.  The 2012 mercury emissions to air were calculated using emission factors from a prior compliance stack test.  SDI conducted another compliance stack test for mercury and lead in April 2013.  When the facility entered the resulting emission factors into its calculations for the 2013 Form R reporting, it inadvertently entered the lead emission factor for mercury, resulting in the errant mercury emissions increase that USEPA has noted.  When the correct emission factor is used, mercury air emissions in 2013 actually decreased from 2012, to under 11 lbs.  SDI is submitting a revised Form R for CY 2013 correcting this issue.  |TARL:SDI inadvertently used the most recent stack test emission factor for lead rather than the most recent stack test emission factor for mercury when the facility entered resulting emission factors from compliance stack test for mercury and lead in April 2013 into its calculations for the 2013 Form R reporting.
