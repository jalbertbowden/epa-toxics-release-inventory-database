Of that, 10,259 lbs was sent off site to four approved recycling centers and 757 lbs was sent off site as lead contaminated debris to approved RCRA Subtitled C landfills.  The reason for this particular increase is due to a large quantity reduction of uninterrupted power supply (UPS - computer and electronic device battery backup) units.  A total of 5,729 lbs came from these units that contained small sealed lead acid batteries (SSLA) to supply backup power.  The remaining 2,196 lbs from the Small Arms Firing Range and 2,334 lbs from the Motor Pool Automotive batteries were all sent off site to approved battery recycling companies.  The lower reporting of fugitive air emissions is due to two reasons.  The first one being that the TRACEN Small Arms Firing Range was shut down for maintenance and repairs from mid May 2013 until June 2014, so, there was no lead ammunition fired during this time.  The second reason is that there was an error found in the calculation of the fugitive air emissions for lead, in that Frangible Ammunition (zero lead, green ammunition) was added into the equation by mistake when it should have not been.  The TRACEN Environmental Protection Specialist will take look back at RYs 2010, 2011 and 2012 and see if the same miscalculations have been made and if necessary make the adjustments to those prior RY forms.|PRAI:This reduction was due to the the fact that the Small Arms Firing Range utilized for law enforcement officer training was shut doun from late May 2013 to Late June 2014.  No lead containing ammunition was fired during this time.	YES	ERIN.H.CHLUM@USCG.MIL			YES
