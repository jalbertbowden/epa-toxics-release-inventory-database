According to the MSDS supplied by Ecolab, Inc., AC-55-5 Red contains 38% nitric acid by weight and Passivation Acid contains 23% nitric acid by weight. These chemicals are used to clean process tanks and vessels then discharged to a 21,352-gallon onsite wastewater equalization tank. The wastewater is pH neutralized in the tank through active chemical addition and then batch discharged to the Concord Wastewater Treatment Facility three to four times each production day. Use of the sanitizing agents and neutralization in the wastewater equalization tank dissociates the nitric acid into nitrate compounds and it is assumed that all of the nitric acid is treated onsite. However, there is a possibility that trace amounts of nitric acid are dischrged to the POTW for treatment. Based on the quantities of nitric acid used, we calculate that HP Hood produced approximately 15,150 lbs of NaNO3 onsite during calendar year 2013, which is below the 25,000 lb threshold for manufacture. HP Hood is actively working with Ecolab to purchase sanitizing chemicals with lower concentrations of toxic chemicals.	NO	MICHAEL.ANDERSON@HPHOOD.COM			NO
