This type of application results in less runoff of pollutants compared to surface applied fertilizers.  The Pantex Plant operates a subsurface irrigation system for the purpose of beneficially using treated wastewater.  The four 100 acre tracts are located at Pantex on DOE owned property. The subsurface irrigation system uses treated water from an onsite wastewater treatment system and onsite pump and treat groundwater remediation systems.  The treated water is pumped to a central processing station that injects the Ammonium Nitrate solution into the subsurface irrigation lines that irrigates and fertilizes the crops.  The result of using subsurface irrigation practices has utilized a more efficient use of water application and a more efficient fertilizing method.|SRNA:Source reduction in the farming practice would cause product quality to decline.
