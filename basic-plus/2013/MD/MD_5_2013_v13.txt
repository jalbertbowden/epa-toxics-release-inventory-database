Regulatory controls apply to many of the releases reported that are production related and reporting facilities must comply with environmental standards in addition to reporting residual releases. The mining industry¿s reports reflect the high volume of materials managed on-site. These materials are managed in engineered facilities that are permitted and regulated by exacting state and federal laws. All non-accidental releases reported under TRI are specifically approved under environmental laws, such as air emissions under the Clean Air Act or water discharges under the Clean Water Act. Moreover, mining facilities are fully-regulated and operational controls are in place to minimize any releases that would impact water and air quality.	NO	DAVE.THOMAS@ARLP.COM			YES
