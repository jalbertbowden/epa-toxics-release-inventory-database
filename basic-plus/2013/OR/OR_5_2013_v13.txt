Styrene is the only EPCRA chemical we are required to report on the TRI.  At this facility, Orenco Systems uses an infusion process to manufacture our primary product.   Infusion is the process pulling catalyzed resin into a mold that is under vacuum and sealed with plastic sheeting.  Closed molding processes, such as infusion, are a superior means of pollution control, reducing hazardous air pollutant emissions to a fraction of what is common for open molding processes. 70% of the resin we purchased last year for this facility was used to manufacture products using the infusion process.  If all our products were made using open molding processes our styrene emissions would have been approximately 19900 lbs for the 2013 reporting year.  Our actual syrene emissions at this facility were 9862 lbs.  This is a 102% reduction in hazardous air pollutant emissions.  Orenco Systems, Inc.  is able to attain such low emissions levels because of our widespread use of closed molding production processes like infusion.|SRNA:Pollution prevention previously implemented - additional reduction does not appear technically feasible.

Permapost is required by various state and federal permits to perform many specific cleaning and maintenance tasks that result in the generation of HW.  For instance, Permapost employees must wash down the drip pad every week, which generates wastewater sent to the evaporators and the evaporator sludges are sent off as hazardous waste.   Any rainfall that lands inside the tank farm and other process areas must be collected and processed through the evaporators also.  Any process wastewater that can be re-used must be run through an oil/water separator and activated carbon.

Styrene is the only  EPCRA chemical we are required to report on the TRI .  Orenco Systems uses a molding process called "resin transfer" technology (RTM) to produce our largest and/or highest volume products.  In the RTM process, catalyzed resin is injected into a closed, vacuum sealed mold.   This is state of the art technology in the fiberglass manufacturing industry.  Closed molding processes are a superior means of pollution control, reducing hazardous air pollutant emissions to a fraction of what is common for open molding processes.  95% of the resin we purchased last year was used to manufacture products on RTM molds.  If all our products were made using open molding processes our styrene emissions would have been approximately 49900 lbs for the 2013 reporting year.  Our actual styrene emissions last year were 11912 lbs.  This is a 319% reduction in hazardous air pollutant emissions.  Orenco Systems, Inc. is able to attain such low emissions levels because of our widespread use of closed molding production processes.|SRNA:Pollution prevention previously implemented - additional reduction does not appear technically or economically feasible.
