All our steel goes into products with all scrap, including steel shavings, picked up for re-melting by recyclers.  The only release into the environment are steel particles found in floor sweepings that is nearly all dirt, and this to a landfill.  I have vastly over-estimated 100 lbs of steel in these sweepings per year  to qualify for filing, as P20 directions state "Cutting, grinding .. or otherwise processing of manufactured items could result in a release of EPCRA Sec. 313 chemical during normal conditions of processing... and therefore negate the exemption as articles."  Our engineer affirms there is no loss of steel in the welding process, but we cut and grind so must file this report.  I would reasonably estimate we lose 1/4 lb of manganese, nickel or chromium to the environment, which are all natural elements anyway.  We do not filter metal prarticles from floor sweepings to determine volume of steel in them for calculation of manganese and nickel content.	NO	VNORRIS@HAMMERSMITHMFG.COM			YES
