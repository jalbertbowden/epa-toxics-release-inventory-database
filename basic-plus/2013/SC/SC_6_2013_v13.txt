In 2013 more waste was shipped off-site for treatment and disposal than was treated on site in prior years.|TOTRL:This is correct.  In 2013 much less of the wastewater from the process was treated on-site (biodegraded) and the waste stream was shifted to off-site landfilling, without treatment by biodegradation.|TWRL:This is correct.

The smelters claimed that our lead waste had a small percentage of lead by volume, and that the larger portion was mainly inert materials that they couldn't get permitted to handle.  We were given an indication in early 2014, that the smelters would re-start accepting low volume lead waste.  This hasn't happened to date.  Going forward, 2014, most of our low level lead waste will be going landfill, until another smelter comes online.  Our efforts have been exhausting, in contracting a smelter that will accept low level lead waste, co-mingled with high volumes of inert materials.  Our facility has also began researching reductions in the volume of inert materials which contact lead dust within our process;  the goal being, to significantly reduce the amount of lead waste going to landfill.
