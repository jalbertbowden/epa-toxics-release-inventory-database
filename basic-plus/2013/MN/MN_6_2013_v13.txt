During this treatment, H2S is produced along with methane gas before being sent to a biogas flare.  On December 9, 2013, the biogas flare gas line froze from the anaerobic digester.  Liberty Paper's Anaerobic Digester biogas flare (EU010) had its gas line freeze due to cold weather.   Biogas was intermittently released into the atmosphere from the top of the anaerobic digester's pressure relief valve.  Duration was less than 80 hours.To immediately minimize biogas production and release, effluent flow to the Anaerobic Digester was curtailed and the biogas flare gas line was thawed out and heat taped for long term corrective action.  Biogas flare was placed back into normal operations.|NPYF:The anaerobic digester when into normal operations in early 2013.  No H2S emmisions occurred before the installation of the digester.

This was due to entirely to customer demand of the same types of mercury switch products as the 2012 and previous reporting years.  The increase in TRI of mercury for the 2013 reporting year as compared to the 2012 reporting year is directly proportional to the increase in sales for mercury float switch products.  In addition there have been no changes to the methods of production that would contribute to increases in TRI of mercury.	NO	PAUL.BRILL@SJERHOMBUS.COM			YES
