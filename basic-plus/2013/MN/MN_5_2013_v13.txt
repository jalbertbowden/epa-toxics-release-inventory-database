Based the volume of paste consumed by the process, this procedure only reduces our waste creation by a miniscule amount therefore the effectiveness of this practice is not able to be evaluated.To further reduce the generation of lead waste in our SMT process in 2009 a humidification system was installed in both our St. Peter location and our Mankato location to control the humidity levels during the winter months. The elevated humidity levels prevent paste in our SMT process from drying out and having to be scrapped when it becomes unusable. As stated in the above process based on the volume of paste consumed by the process, this procedure only reduces our waste creation by a miniscule amount therefore the effectiveness of this practice is not able to be evaluated.To reduce the generation of lead waste in our wave process our lead wave solder machine is only turned on when based on the production schedulre to reduce the amount of hours the SnPb solder is in the molten state. This will reduce the amount of dross oxides that form on the surface of the molten solder. Dross removal is only when needed by the production schedule which is very irregular during the start-up year of this facility so we are unable to evaluate the amount of reduction in lead waste for this process.  On July 2006 a directive went into effect commonly referred to as RoHS directive (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) that required any product or consumer goods sold in the Europe union to be free of six hazardous materials one of which was lead. To meet this directives goals in late 2004 with the cooperation of our customers we started developing our lead-free process which eliminated the use of SnPb alloys in favor of a nearly pure tin alloys. Starting in 2005 some of our customer began producing their product using this new lead-free process. Over the past several years our customers have continued to switch to using lead-free alloys which has had the biggest amount of impact on the amount of lead used/purchased.

The amount of stainless product produced in 2013 was down approximately 30% from calendar year 2012 resulting in reduced usage of stainless raw materials. The company has various pollution control activities it utilizes. Fume extractors are used to capture cutting and welding emissions and the clean air is released back into the facility. Storm water pollution prevention practices are in place and all raw materials are stored inside the facility. Inventory controls are used and inventory is reviewed monthly. Stainless materials are brought in on a as needed basis. Engineering reviews products to minimize weight thus material where possible and to minimize scrap. The company is ISO 14001 certified and management of waste and recycling practices are reviewed regularly.|SRNA:Chromium is a component of the stainless steel material used in making our product.
