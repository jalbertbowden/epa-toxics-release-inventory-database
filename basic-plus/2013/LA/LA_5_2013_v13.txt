Univar implements pollution prevention activities and is conscientious regarding impact to the environment. Univar uses currently available methods of treatment and/or disposal for hazardous wastes, which minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment. These methods are in the treatment standards and technologies contained in the RCRA hazardous waste regulations, or are the best demonstrated available technologies (BADT). The following Univar waste minimization program applies to all wastes managed at the facility, including wastes generated from operations on-site and waste received into storage: 1) Personnel have been trained in procedures to reduce the creation of waste resulting from poor operational practices, such as, damage during warehousing.2) A standard operating practice of rotating stock has been established to keep inventories from exceeding its recommended shelf life. 3) A standard operating practice has been established to maintain inventories at an appropriate level to only service or customer¿s needs, reducing the potential for product to exceed its recommended shelf life. 4) A standard operating practice has been established to identify excess product inventories and to sell products nearing their shelf life dates. 5) A standard operating practice has been established which requires us to contact manufacturers of the products we warehouse to recycle out-of-date and damaged chemicals. 6) A standard operating practice of equipment dedication (as feasible) reduces the need to create flush line waste. 7) A standard operating practice has been established to reduce the amount of material used when flushing the lines before repackaging. 8) A standard operating practice has been established to develop customers that can beneficially use line flush as product. 9) A program for introducing new and innovate technology is in place to utilize equipment and develop operating practices which will reduce the amount of waste created (OSM 6.42). 10) A management team has been formed to develop methods of reducing waste generated.
