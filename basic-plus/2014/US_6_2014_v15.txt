Since 2014 was the first full year that the EO/PO Railcar Unloading Scrubber was used during PO railcar unloading, the facility exceeded the Form R reporting threshold for propylene oxide due to on-site treatment of PO in the scrubber.  In preparation of the RY2016 TRI report it was recognized that propylene oxide exceeded the Form R threshold during RY2014 and RY2015 and that propylene oxide required RY2014 and RY2015 Form R reporting.

Materials used as a registered soil amendment and lime substitute in reclamation contain small amounts of crustal earth elements including selenium. Chemical constituents of the material are heavily influenced by the coal combusted and the source limestone used in the scrubber system. The 65% increase in selenium content of the material suggests a coal supply change at the station. Varying selenium content of the materials used as a registered soil amendment and lime substitute in reclamation coupled with tonnages received determine whether the reporting threshold is met on a yearly basis. Selenium did not reach any reporting threshold in 2013 and may not in the  2015 report year, depending upon the variables above.

While natural gasoline is blended in with the 200-proof ethanol, a corrosion inhibiting fluid is also added. The corrosion inhibitor is added at a ratio of 10 pounds per 42,000 gallons of ethanol. The corrosion inhibitor is manufactured with 20% methanol. The releases of methanol are based on the emissions associated with handling and storing the corrosion inhibitor. Methanol is produced during the fermentation process of creating ethanol. The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank (fermenter) for about 3 days. While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars. During this time yeast cells are added to the fermenter. The yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. Methanol is a byproduct of fermentation. The methanol becomes en-trained in the gas stream leaving the fermenter.

The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank (fermenter) for about 3 days. While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars. During this time yeast cells are added to the fermenter. The yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. Formaldehyde is a byproduct of fermentation. The formaldehyde become en-trained in the gas stream leaving the fermenter. This gas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied in a carbon dioxide purification plant. The water flow rate on the wet scrubber is controlled to maintain compliance with environmental regulations and emissions stack testing data. Formaldehyde is produced in an intermediate reaction in the combustion of natural gas. POET Preston has two steam boilers on natural gas, two dryers with one natural gas burner each, and an RTO with three natural gas burners.	NO	CHRIS.HANSON@POET.COM			NO

I have vastly over-estimated 100 lbs of steel in these sweepings per year to qualify for filing, as P20 directions state "Cutting, grinding... or other processes of manufactured items could result in a release of EPCRA Sec 313 chemical during normal conditions of processing.. . and therefore negate the exemption articles". Our engineer affirms there is no loss of steel in the welding process but we cut and grind and so must file this report.  I would reasonably estimate 1/4 lb of manganese nickel or chromium to the environment, which are all natural elements.
