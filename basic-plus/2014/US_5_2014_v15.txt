The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank (fermenter) for about 3 days. While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars. During this time yeast cells are added to the fermenter. The yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. Formic acid is a byproduct of fermentation. Some of the formic acid becomes en-trained in the gas stream leaving the fermenter. This gas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied in a carbon dioxide purification plant. The water flow rate on the wet scrubber is controlled to maintain compliance with environmental regulations and emissions stack testing data. The remainder of the formic acid stays with the fermentation solids until they are dried in the dryers; the dyer gasses are burned in a RTO.	NO	CHRIS.HANSON@POET.COM			NO

All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard. We continued to implement our minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water.  This dry-machining process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional wet-machining that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. MQL has other benefits in addition to water savings. It reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more to approximately 100 milliliters or about half the size of an average drinking glass. And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	PEDDS@FORD.COM			YES

All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard. We continued to implement our minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water.  This dry-process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional wet-machining that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. MQL has other benefits in addition to water savings. It reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more to approximately 100 milliliters or about half the size of an average drinking glass. And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	PEDDS@FORD.COM			YES

This dry-machining process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional wet-machining that required large amounts of metal-working fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.	NO	RJOHNSON3@FORD.COM			YES
