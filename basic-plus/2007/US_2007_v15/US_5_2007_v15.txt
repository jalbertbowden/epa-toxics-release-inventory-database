This substitution has resulted in a 57% reduction in weight per linear foot of rdc scrap generated.  during the reporting period, from january 1, 1999 through december 31, 2002 psemc generated 9,525 ft.  Or 59 lbs.  Of rdc scrap.  The substitution of tin for lead in this instance resulted in a net reduction of 81 lbs.  From january 1, 1995 through december 31, 2002 psemc generated 163,393 ft.  Or 1019 lbs.  Of rdc tin scrap.  The substitution of tin for lead since inception resulted in a net reduction of 1351 lbs.  Sr-2 It was discovered that the tin tubes being supplied to psemc had stainless steel impurities.  These impurities would literally surface during the processing of the product.  The impurities were deemed as the root cause for the tube breakage psemc had experienced during processing which resulted in additional scrap generation.  The supplier corrected the problem as requested by filtering out the stainless impurities from the tin in the molten state with a ceramic filter.  Although psemc knows this was an effective source reduction, variability in the production process make it impossible to quantify the reduction.  Sr-3 Psemc implemented a procedural tube loading modification.  The change involved increasing the load time by 15-30 minutes per tube.  This ensures that the upper end of the tube is loaded with the proper amount of powder to meet an expected mass ratio of metal to powder.    these changes have been the most significant improvement in our efforts to reduce scrap at the front end of the process.  As an example, from 1996-1997, psemc was using 2,250 feet per tube as its production average yield.  After implementing these improvements, psemc is now experiencing an average yield of nearly 2,600 feet per tube.  This savings translates to a scrap reduction that has been estimated as follows (1999): (671 tubes/Year)(2,600 feet/Tube-2,250 feet/Tube) = 234,850 feet per year (1,465 lbs) the total source reduction achieved as a result of implementation of these sr measures since inception, january 1, 1998 through december 31, 2002 is as follows (3303 tubes/Year)(2,600 feet/Tube-2,250 feet/Tube) = 1,156,050 feet per year (7,213 lbs)	NO	CMARTIN@PSEMC.COM			YES

The nuts are now heated to a higher temperature before they are loaded into the sterilization chamber.  The higher temperature causes the nuts to absorb the PPO better and release it more slowly.  After the nuts are removed from the sterilization chambers the PPO continues to off-gas in a post-processing area for several days.  Therefore, while the overall PPO usage in 2007 was less than the PPO usage in 2006, the fugitive emissions (Part II, Section 5.1) increased due to a change in processing method.

Multiple ink products have been and will continue to be evaluated and reformulated to remove methanol as an ingredient.  European regulatory requirements are driving the change: gmp regulation 2023/2006/Ec in conjunction with forthcoming eupia guidelines for food packaging inks.  This changeover includes removing ethanol denatured with methanol as a raw material.  Though not identified in the 2006 reporting year data, methanol is 5% of the weight volume of ethanol used on-Site for ink manufacture.  Denatured ethanol volumes average 230,000 - 240,000 pounds / year which equates to an annual 23,500 pounds of methanol on-Site, a portion of which is released to the atmosphere as fugitive emissions.  It is anticipated removing all methanol from the fluids manufacturing process during the next year will drastically reduce the pounds released as reported on the TRI report for the facility as this is the only listed chemical that is in use.

Although it does not reduce overall TRI chemicals and compounds disposed of, we segregate incoming wastewaters to reduce the generation of filtration solids for disposal by landfill or incineration.ADDITIONAL: Most of TMDPSs reported TRI chemicals and compounds is related to the injection of commercially received waste into two (2) Class I Hazardous Injection Wells each with an EPA No Migration Petition. Although injected under strict conditions of an Underground Injection Control Permit and the No Migration Petition, these TRI releases are reportable amounts. The amendments to this Form R are being made as the result of a voluntary compliance evaluation of our internal EPCRA data management and reporting procedures under the EPAs Small Business Compliance Policy.

The coolant is filtered, and the filtrant is sent to a recycler.  In those few instances where coolant is not used, we have installed dust collectors that are emptied into a bin and sent to a recycler.

The bulk of the off site recycling amount comes from stainless steel.  The increase in the amount of off site recycling came from design changes by the customer that created additional off fall scrap from the press operation. The increase in the amount recycled compared to last year off site is due to the customer changing from 400 stainless steel to 300 stainless steel.

The dcm from a production process that utilizes a large amount of the dcm used during the reporting period as part of a closed-Loop system is reclaimed for re-Use with an automated solvent recovery system.  Periodically, spent dcm in the closed-Loop system is is accumulated for shipment to an off-Site licensed disposal company for incineration.  During this reporting period, the production process utilizing the majority of the dcm in the facility was scaled up as part of a new product development.  While the overall demand for dcm increased due to the scaled up process equipment, the automated solvent recovery system reduced the overall demand for additional dcm to be introduced into the process and subsequently sent for off-Site disposal.  Also, improvements to the process design were made to reduce the potential for spills/Leaks.  The dcm recovery process for eventual recycling effectively produces a near 100% recovery of the solvent introduced into the process, thus mininiming air emissions.

Circle Graphics, Inc. is proceeding with a program to assess the substitution of UV curable inks for the current N230 based inks. UV curable inks contain no N230 and only minimal amounts of non-TAP VOC. The company has purchased 4 new printers that utilize UV curable inks. These printers are in production; and work continues in assessing further refinements in the inks used to expand the use of UV curable inks.  The capture effeciency of the vent hoods over the printers was increased by modifying the hood design. The increase in capture efficiency resulted in a very high percentage of all fugitive emissions being routed to the RTO, and thus reduced ambient air emissions.

The threshold was exceeded again in 2007, and is expected to do so again in 2008 and 2009.  The activity index was reported based on comparison of craft hours expended in 2007 compared to 2006, although it could have been marked na.  There was an unquantified release of propylene when the underground distribution system for propane failed; discovery occured on 11/15/07.  The odorized propane was promptly discovered and the system was shut down.  The leak was downstream of any metering devices; however, propane usage at the time of the event was consistent with propane usage prior to the event.  It is believed that very little of the propane (Containing approximately 5% propylene) was actually lost from the 2" low pressure line prior to discovery.  If the event could have been quantified, it would have been reported in section 8.8.  The total fugitive emissions of propylene reported as a range of 10 to 499 pounds in section 5.1 do not inculde this unquantified release; however, it is believed that the total fugitive releases of propylene would still fall within the reported range, even if the event had been quantified and included.  There is no cercla rq for propylene, so this was not a reportable event.	YES	RICHARD.BUEL@RL.DOE.GOV			NO

The lead we currently use is by way of our hot-Air solder level (Hasl), which applies a layer of tin-Lead solder to circuit boards.  We also reduced this form of lead usage several years ago through an upgrade in our maintenance staff.  Our former practice was to replace the approximately 800 lbs of 63-37 [63% tin-37% lead] solder in our hasl whenver the copper content reached 0.3%.  This would occur every few months.  Now, we maintain our hasl by drossing the solder periodically.  The knowledge of this process by our current maintenance staff enables us to replenish the solder we use rather than replace the entire 800 lbs, which is a substantial reduction.

This leaves very little room for changes to procedures and processing materials.  For these reasons, the nature of ripak's attempts to reduce the amount of waste generated are more procedural in nature.  For example, in order to process large parts, many of the tanks need to be quite large to accommodate the largest part to be processed.  Waste generation is minimized by arranging production schedules to put the largest quantity of work in a given run, by using several smaller rinses instead of only one large rinse.  Production indices are used in evaluating increases in hazardous waste generation attributed to changes in activity and calculated on simple economic basis.  This production index is as meaningful an indicator as any available.	NO	TCALDECUTT@RIPAK.COM	RR4		NO

Claymont steel recycles approximately 500,000 tons per year of scrap steel in an electric arc furnace (Eaf).  The usepa identified eaf shops as sources of mercury emissions which can be traced to the scrap metal feedstock that is used to produce steel.  The primary source of mercury contamination in scrap metal is from mercury switches used in automobile hood and trunk convenience lighting.  When these devices are not removed prior to crushing and shredding the scrapped automobiles, the mercury becomes entrained in the scrap and volatilized in the melting process.  Claymont steel and other eaf recyclers do not want or receive any benefit from mercury in the scrap metal received from suppliers in the region.  Claymont steel remains committed to reduce mercury emissions from this facility.  To this end, claymont steel has implemented a number of source reduction measures to reduce mercury from entering the eaf via the scrap metal feed.  These initial measures are part of an overall pollution prevention program to further reduce the amount of mercury in the eaf feed and to reduce mercury emissions.  Claymont steel believes this is the most expeditious and environmentally beneficial alternative.  The source reduction measures are discussed below: national vehicle mercury switch removal program (Nvmsrp).  Claymont steel joined forces with other members of the steel manufacturers association (Sma) and the american iron and steel institute (Aisi) to establish the nvmsrp.  Claymont steel entered into this agreement with other steelmakers to fully fund the nvmsrp over a three year period.  Foster relationships with suppliers who participate in the nvmsrp.  Claymont steel will continue to purchase from suppliers who participate in the nvmsrp.  Ultimately, this is the most environmentally beneficial program because the mercury is recovered and recycled in a separate stream rather than allowing the mercury switch to be shredded and volatilized in an eaf at a steelmaking facility.  Claymont steel has notified suppliers indicating that we intend to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, scrap from vehicles which do not contain mercury from switches or scrap from vehicles that have had mercury switches removed.  The suppliers have been audited to assess their participation in the program and their ability to meet our purchase specifications.  Auto-Free shred.  Claymont steel has arranged for our shredded scrap suppliers to supply shred that does not contain automobiles.  Since mercury convenience switches from end-Of-Life automobiles is the predominant source of mercury in steel scrap, the elimination of this scrap source has already provided an immediate reduction in mercury emissions.  We have audited these suppliers and found that these suppliers have satisfactory procedures in place.  The volume of auto-Free shred in the region is limited, so claymont steel also purchases shredded scrap from suppliers who have a documented mercury removal program.  No shred from municipal sources.  Claymont steel has ceased using shredded steel scrap from municipal waste incinerators.  This commercial ferrous scrap is magnetically recovered from residual and commercial waste combustion facilities and there is a concern that there could be residual mercury in this source of scrap in the form of thermostats, manometers, button cell batteries, flame sensors and other mercury-Tilt switches.

Using a paint transfer efficiency of 70%, 47487# of copper compounds adhered to the ship.  Of the 30% that did not adhere to the ship (20351# of copper compounds), 10% of that (2035#) are assumed to have escaped as particulate, leaving 18316#.  Half of the balance of 18316# (or 9158#) is assumed to have adhered to the blasting grit on the drydock floor (which is hauled by Charter Environmental after TCLP), and the other half (9158#) is assumed to have adhered to the blocks that support the ship, the tarps, and the drydock itself.  It is estimated that about 10% of this portion (or about 916#) ends up on the tarps, which have a service life of about 1 year.  The tarps are removed via dumpster by EZ Disposal Service Inc.  To summarize, of the 67838# of copper compounds, 47487# end up on the ship, 2035# are emitted to the atmosphere as particulate matter, 9158# are disposed with the blasting grit after negative TCLP (Charter Environmental), 916# are disposed with the tarps (EZ Disposal Services), and 8242# end up on the blocks and other drydock structures.

The amounts processed, disposed of on-site, and sent off-site for further waste management is largely dependant on our waste receipts and the efforts of our customers to reduce the TRI compounds associated with the wastes they ship to us. Although it does not reduce overall TRI chemicals and compounds disposed of, we segregate incoming wastewaters to reduce the generation of filtration solids for disposal by landfill or incineration.ADDITIONAL: Most of TMDPSs reported TRI chemicals and compounds is related to the injection of commercially received waste into two (2) Class I Hazardous Injection Wells each with an EPA No Migration Petition. Although injected under strict conditions of an Underground Injection Control Permit and the No Migration Petition, these TRI releases are reportable amounts.

The two entities are located on one contiguous property and are comprised of two business units which were purchased at separate time periods.  Tri data were historically reported separately for these two entities under separate facility ids.  1.  Huntsman corporation - o&O facility, TRI id: 77651txcchhwy36 and 2.  Huntsman corporation - po/Mtbe plant, TRI id: 77651txcch2701s.  Huntsman requested and received approval from epa to consolidate the two above entities into one trifid.  The consolidation of both former facility ids described above was done and the new, consolidated trifid.  The consolidated trifid is trifid is 77651-Txcch-Hwy36.

This includes native and labeled chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans.  These substances are periodically manufactured on a very small scale and held in inventory until needed for further processing.  Small quantities of these raw materials are formulated into various dilute concentration reference standards.  Cerilliant tests outdated materials and re-Certifies them for continued use whenever possible.  Consideration is given to recovering and reusing raw materials from formulations that are outdated and can not be re-Certified.  In many cases, only enough raw material required to be carried forward in the formulated standard is manufactured, thus minimizing the amount of raw material made.  When manufacturing the raw materials, reaction vessels are configured in a closed system design, which includes traps to eliminate the possibility of air emissions.

As a result, total lead purchases are projected to decrease from 1900 pounds in 2005 to 500 pounds in 2009.   In Section 8. of this report, the values listed in Column C are assumed to be 29% less than the values listed in columns B.

The most significant aspect of base operations contributing to the exceedance of this TRI threshold is the use of lead ammunition at the Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Range.  Accordingly, the Hazardous Materials Risk Management Team is pursuing the option of so-called "green ammunition" - lead-free bullets made of a tungsten-tin composite - for use on the CATM range.  This type of ammunition is acceptable for training purposes and would substantively reduce the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation, lessen the risk of personnel exposure to lead fumes and dust, and mitigate the potential for lead contamination of the soil and runoff at the CATM Range. Given the time required to procure "green ammunition" through the Department of Defense distribution system, Vandenberg AFB does not anticipate significantly increasing its allocation until calendar year 2009.  Accordingly, starting with reporting year 2009, Vandenberg AFB may expect to realize a 25 percent per year reduction in the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation.  In the interim, Vandenberg AFB is continuing to explore the advisability of using bullet traps to mitigate the adverse environmental impact of lead ammunition.

However, all of this lead was properly disposed of in permitted facilities that were in full compliance with ldr requirements for lead.  The only significant release of lead to the environment that was not into a permitted facility was the 9,136 pounds of lead from ammunition fired at the hanford patrol firing range (Reported in section 8.1b).  Although the 2,130,000 pounds of lead from cercla remediation waste are shown as a "Release to the environment" reported in section 8.8, the actual situation is that this quantity of lead was cleaned up from the environment, and placed into a permanent compliant disposal facility.

The hexane from a production process that utilizes a large amount of the hexane used during the reporting period as part of a closed-Loop system is reclaimed for re-Use with an automated solvent recovery system.  Periodically, spent hexane in the closed-Loop system is is accumulated for shipment to an off-Site licensed disposal company for incineration.  During this reporting period, the production process utilizing the majority of the hexane in the facility was scaled up as part of a new product development.  While the overall demand for hexane increased due to the scaled up process equipment, the automated solvent recovery system reduced the overall demand for additional hexane to be introduced into the process and subsequently sent for off-Site disposal.  Also, improvements to the process design were made to reduce the potential for spills/Leaks.  The hexane recovery process for eventual recycling effectively produces a near 100% recovery of the solvent introduced into the process.	NO	RICHARD_TRAMMELL@CERILLIANT.COM			NO

Most of the time, this material pure enough to reuse as raw material.  During 2007 the site was able to purchase in-Between 2,230 kg and 2,700 kg less trans raw material because of this activity and has resulted in almost a $30,000 raw material cost avoidance savings.  A new source reduction activity is a transition to a new process of consolidating residual material from customer returned bubblers as well as bubbler cleaning by using a "No break" bubbler.  This process also resulted in the reuse of this material as well as purchasing less trans raw material, about 9,000 kg.  This activity generated an additional $50,000 in trans raw material cost avoidance savings for the year.

(See attached leak detection summary sheets.)  Weekly solvent use meetings with key management personnel.   Plant air quality improvement project  The project was undertaken in 2005 and it was completed near years end of 2006.  The project consisted of several walls that were built within the production facility to separate the extrusion/Calendaring operations from the extraction-Product molding/Drying operations.  The walls separate smoke emitting activities from tce emitting activities.  The process oil has very low levels of residual tce now and the bag houses and fiber beds exhaust streams are now discharged to atmosphere.  Roughly 32,000 ft3/Min of air, or half the current sla capacity is currently used in key areas of the plant to reduce fugitives.  A side effect of this discharge that we expect is extended activated carbon life because historically baghouse dust and paq oil smoke have contaminated the carbon.   The project reduced overall plant site trichloroethylene emissions from 113.3 tons in 2006 to 58.9 tons annually by year end of 2007.  In addition to separating the extraction-(Sheet properties setting) & winding sections from the rest of the production operation with walls, we also added a trichloroethylene monitoring system in order to monitor potential fugitive zones and take action to minimize zone concentrations through process adjustments.

The amounts processed, disposed of on-site, and sent off-site for further waste management is largely dependant on our waste receipts and the efforts of our customers to reduce the TRI compounds associated with the wastes they ship to us. Although it does not reduce overall TRI chemicals and compounds disposed of, we segregate incoming wastewaters to reduce the generation of filtration solids for disposal by landfill or incineration.ADDITIONAL: Most of TMDPSs reported TRI chemicals and compounds is related to the injection of commercially received waste into two (2) Class I Hazardous Injection Wells each with an EPA No Migration Petition. Although injected under strict conditions of an Underground Injection Control Permit and the No Migration Petition, these TRI releases are reportable amounts.

I have a concern in the accuracy of reporting lead.  It is an element that generally is not required on material specifications and consequently the steel mills (Melting companies that manufacture the steels) do not report it nor do they analyze it.  Because there is no de minimis exemption in the carbon and alloy grades, i have asked the mills for lead concentrations and they have provided me with statements like "We do not intentionally add lead to our products." and resist in giving me a number.  Others will say our detection level of our instruments is 0.002% so it is less that 0.002%.  My problem is that when i multiply 200m pounds times 0.002% i exceed the 100 lbs lead threshold, but not feeling that i am accurately reporting.  When comparing the 2006 and 2007 amounts of lead processed at my company, there is a 58.5% reduction, but it is only due to the steel mills providing me with lower detection limits when they analyze chemistry during their ladle analysis, (The most accurate analysis).  It also concerns me that no one else seems to be contacting the 5 or 6 mills that i talked with on this subject of reporting lead for TRI reporting.	NO	NKLAES@TIMBERCREEKENV.COM			YES

The amounts processed, disposed of on-site, and sent off-site for further waste management is largely dependant on our waste receipts and the efforts of our customers to reduce the TRI compounds associated with the wastes they ship to us. Although it does not reduce overall TRI chemicals and compounds disposed of, we segregate incoming wastewaters to reduce the generation of filtration solids for disposal by landfill or incineration.ADDITIONAL: Most of TMDPSs reported TRI chemicals and compounds is related to the injection of commercially received waste into two (2) Class I Hazardous Injection Wells each with an EPA No Migration Petition. Although injected under strict conditions of an Underground Injection Control Permit and the No Migration Petition, these TRI releases are reportable amounts.

Requirements for federal agencies to report toxic release inventory (Tri) data began with 1994 data.  A report is required for any listed toxic chemical that is manufactured or processed at a facility in excess of 25,000 pounds during the course of a calender year; or if the quantity of a listed toxic chemical that is otherwise used at a facility exceeds 10,000 pounds during the course of a calendar year.  Entities other than the federal government are required to report if they have a standard industrial code (Sic) of 20-39.  Federal agencies must report regardless of sic code.  Anhydrous ammonia is included as a toxic chemical on the reportable list.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the roman l.  Hruska u.S.  Meat animal research center as fertilizer for production of corn for livestock feed.  No releases to the environment other than the intended use of anhydrous ammonia occur.  Agricultural use of anhydrous ammonia by non-Federal agency consumers would not be required to report.  Soil tests are taken to minimize use of fertilizer to the needs of the intended crop.

The solder used at SEL is composed of 37% lead and 63% tin, so the amount of lead shipped offsite in solder dross for recycling should have been reported as 37% of the total weight of the solder dross, not the entire amount.  Similarly, only the actual lead contained in the solder flux and lead-contaminated wipes, rags, and other materials shipped offsite for treatment or disposal should have been reported on the 2006 Form R report.  All Form R reports for lead in the future from SEL will only show the actual lead content in the offsite waste shipments.

The two entities are located on one contiguous property and are comprised of two business units which were purchased at separate time periods.  Tri data were historically reported separately for these two entities under separate facility ids.  1.  Huntsman corporation - o&O facility, TRI id: 77651txcchhwy36 and 2.  Huntsman corporation - po/Mtbe plant, TRI id: 77651txcch2701s.  Huntsman requested and received approval from epa to consolidate the two above entities into one trifid.  The consolidation of both former facility ids described above was done and the new, consolidated trifid.  The consolidated trifid is trifid is 77651-Txcch-Hwy36.  Although the consolidation of the two entities under one trif ID occurred (Trifid 77651-Txcch-Hwy36), the TRI-Me web database shows 77651-Txcch-Hwy36 as a part of a facility in section 4.2.
