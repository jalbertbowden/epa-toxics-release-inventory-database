Of the 30% that did not adhere to the ship (20351# of copper compounds), 10% of that (2035#) are assumed to have escaped as particulate, leaving 18316#.  Half of the balance of 18316# (or 9158#) is assumed to have adhered to the blasting grit on the drydock floor (which is hauled by Charter Environmental after TCLP), and the other half (9158#) is assumed to have adhered to the blocks that support the ship, the tarps, and the drydock itself.  It is estimated that about 10% of this portion (or about 916#) ends up on the tarps, which have a service life of about 1 year.  The tarps are removed via dumpster by EZ Disposal Service Inc.  To summarize, of the 67838# of copper compounds, 47487# end up on the ship, 2035# are emitted to the atmosphere as particulate matter, 9158# are disposed with the blasting grit after negative TCLP (Charter Environmental), 916# are disposed with the tarps (EZ Disposal Services), and 8242# end up on the blocks and other drydock structures.

In 2005, the company began to offer customers several alternatives to lead-based solder, such as an Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold process.  As a result, total lead purchases are projected to decrease from 1900 pounds in 2005 to 500 pounds in 2009.   In Section 8. of this report, the values listed in Column C are assumed to be 29% less than the values listed in columns B.  This is based on the assumption of lead purchases decreasing from 1400 pounds in 2007 to 1000 pounds in 2008.  The values listed in column D are assumed to be 50% less than the values in column C.  This is based on the assumption of lead purchases decreasing from 1000 pounds in 2008 to 500 pounds in 2009.  Therefore, with the exception of 2007, source reduction for lead has been signifcant since 2005, and is expected to continue in 2009.	NO	BCAPAR@METROCIRCUITS.COM			YES

19703CTSTL4001P	1307205905538	N458	MERCURY COMPOUNDS	PBT	2007	CLAYMONT STEEL	4001 PHILADELPHIA PIKE	CLAYMONT	NEW CASTLE	DE	19703	YES	NO	NO	NO								331221						39.807579	-75.448381	188183891										CLAYMONT STEEL RECYCLES APPROXIMATELY 500,000 TONS PER YEAR OF SCRAP STEEL IN AN ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE (EAF).  THE USEPA IDENTIFIED EAF SHOPS AS SOURCES OF MERCURY EMISSIONS WHICH CAN BE TRACED TO THE SCRAP METAL FEEDSTOCK THAT IS USED TO PRODUCE STEEL.  THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF MERCURY CONTAMINATION IN SCRAP METAL IS FROM MERCURY SWITCHES USED IN AUTOMOBILE HOOD AND TRUNK CONVENIENCE LIGHTING.  WHEN THESE DEVICES ARE NOT REMOVED PRIOR TO CRUSHING AND SHREDDING THE SCRAPPED AUTOMOBILES, THE MERCURY BECOMES ENTRAINED IN THE SCRAP AND VOLATILIZED IN THE MELTING PROCESS.  CLAYMONT STEEL AND OTHER EAF RECYCLERS DO NOT WANT OR RECEIVE ANY BENEFIT FROM MERCURY IN THE SCRAP METAL RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS IN THE REGION.    CLAYMONT STEEL REMAINS COMMITTED TO REDUCE MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM THIS FACILITY.  TO THIS END, CLAYMONT STEEL HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF SOURCE REDUCTION MEASURES TO REDUCE MERCURY FROM ENTERING THE EAF VIA THE SCRAP METAL FEED.  THESE INITIAL MEASURES ARE PART OF AN OVERALL POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM TO FURTHER REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MERCURY IN THE EAF FEED AND TO REDUCE MERCURY EMISSIONS.  CLAYMONT STEEL BELIEVES THIS IS THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS AND ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL ALTERNATIVE. THE SOURCE REDUCTION MEASURES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW:    NATIONAL VEHICLE MERCURY SWITCH REMOVAL PROGRAM (NVMSRP).   CLAYMONT STEEL JOINED FORCES WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE STEEL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (SMA) AND THE AMERICAN IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE (AISI) TO ESTABLISH THE NVMSRP.   CLAYMONT STEEL ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITH OTHER STEELMAKERS TO FULLY FUND THE NVMSRP OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD.    FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE NVMSRP.  CLAYMONT STEEL WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE FROM SUPPLIERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE NVMSRP.  ULTIMATELY, THIS IS THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL PROGRAM BECAUSE THE MERCURY IS RECOVERED AND RECYCLED IN A SEPARATE STREAM RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE MERCURY SWITCH TO BE SHREDDED AND VOLATILIZED IN AN EAF AT A STEELMAKING FACILITY.   CLAYMONT STEEL HAS NOTIFIED SUPPLIERS INDICATING THAT WE INTEND TO UTILIZE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE, SCRAP FROM VEHICLES WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN MERCURY FROM SWITCHES OR SCRAP FROM VEHICLES THAT HAVE HAD MERCURY SWITCHES REMOVED.  THE SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN AUDITED TO ASSESS THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND THEIR ABILITY TO MEET OUR PURCHASE SPECIFICATIONS.    AUTO-FREE SHRED.  CLAYMONT STEEL HAS ARRANGED FOR OUR SHREDDED SCRAP SUPPLIERS TO SUPPLY SHRED THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN AUTOMOBILES.  SINCE MERCURY CONVENIENCE SWITCHES FROM END-OF-LIFE AUTOMOBILES IS THE PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF MERCURY IN STEEL SCRAP, THE ELIMINATION OF THIS SCRAP SOURCE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN MERCURY EMISSIONS.  WE HAVE AUDITED THESE SUPPLIERS AND FOUND THAT THESE SUPPLIERS HAVE SATISFACTORY PROCEDURES IN PLACE.  THE VOLUME OF AUTO-FREE SHRED IN THE REGION IS LIMITED, SO CLAYMONT STEEL ALSO PURCHASES SHREDDED SCRAP FROM SUPPLIERS WHO HAVE A DOCUMENTED MERCURY REMOVAL PROGRAM.     NO SHRED FROM MUNICIPAL SOURCES.  CLAYMONT STEEL HAS CEASED USING SHREDDED STEEL SCRAP FROM MUNICIPAL WASTE INCINERATORS.  THIS COMMERCIAL FERROUS SCRAP IS MAGNETICALLY RECOVERED FROM RESIDUAL AND COMMERCIAL WASTE COMBUSTION FACILITIES AND THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THERE COULD BE RESIDUAL MERCURY IN THIS SOURCE OF SCRAP IN THE FORM OF THERMOSTATS, MANOMETERS, BUTTON CELL BATTERIES, FLAME SENSORS AND OTHER MERCURY-TILT SWITCHES.    REVISE THE SCRAP MIX.  CLAYMONT STEEL HAS REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF SHREDDED SCRAP CHARGED TO THE EAF AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL FEEDSTOCK.  OTHER SCRAP GRADES NOT CONTAINING AUTO SCRAP HAVE BEEN SUBSTITUTED TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE AVAILABLE AND FEASIBLE.	NO				YES

Only one production line and a prototype build out line remain as all other production has been transfered to the overseas facility during 2007.  The decrease in production is further evidenced by the huge reduction of off site transfers. Source reduction and recycling activities will increase in 2008-2009 with total suspension of all production lines and subsequent elimination of expired raw goods and outdated product.

It can be explained by the use of a new calculation factor to coincide with our new State of Florida air permit effective on Feb 1, 2007. We had been advised by a State official to use older factor calculations until our old permit expired on Jan 31, 2007. At that time the official indicated that this explaination should be included in our TRI 2007 report.	NO	NA			NO

BECAUSE THERE IS NO DE MINIMIS EXEMPTION IN THE CARBON AND ALLOY GRADES, I HAVE ASKED THE MILLS FOR LEAD CONCENTRATIONS AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED ME WITH STATEMENTS LIKE "WE DO NOT INTENTIONALLY ADD LEAD TO OUR PRODUCTS." AND RESIST IN GIVING ME A NUMBER.  OTHERS WILL SAY OUR DETECTION LEVEL OF OUR INSTRUMENTS IS 0.002% SO IT IS LESS THAT 0.002%.  MY PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN I MULTIPLY 200M POUNDS TIMES 0.002% I EXCEED THE 100 LBS LEAD THRESHOLD, BUT NOT FEELING THAT I AM ACCURATELY REPORTING.   WHEN COMPARING THE 2006 AND 2007 AMOUNTS OF LEAD PROCESSED AT MY COMPANY, THERE IS A 58.5% REDUCTION, BUT IT IS ONLY DUE TO THE STEEL MILLS PROVIDING ME WITH LOWER DETECTION LIMITS WHEN THEY ANALYZE CHEMISTRY DURING THEIR LADLE ANALYSIS, (THE MOST ACCURATE ANALYSIS).

The most significant aspect of base operations contributing to the exceedance of this TRI threshold is the use of lead ammunition at the Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Range.  Accordingly, the Hazardous Materials Risk Management Team is pursuing the option of so-called "green ammunition" - lead-free bullets made of a tungsten-tin composite - for use on the CATM range.  This type of ammunition is acceptable for training purposes and would substantively reduce the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation, lessen the risk of personnel exposure to lead fumes and dust, and mitigate the potential for lead contamination of the soil and runoff at the CATM Range. Given the time required to procure "green ammunition" through the Department of Defense distribution system, Vandenberg AFB does not anticipate significantly increasing its allocation until calendar year 2009.  Accordingly, starting with reporting year 2009, Vandenberg AFB may expect to realize a 25 percent per year reduction in the amount of lead otherwise used on the installation.  In the interim, Vandenberg AFB is continuing to explore the advisability of using bullet traps to mitigate the adverse environmental impact of lead ammunition.

(See attached leak detection summary sheets.)  Weekly solvent use meetings with key management personnel.  Plant Air Quality Improvement Project   The project was undertaken in 2005 and it was completed near years end of 2006. The project consisted of several walls that were built within the production facility to separate the extrusion/calendaring operations from the extraction-product molding/drying operations.  The walls separate smoke emitting activities from TCE emitting activities.  The process oil has very low levels of residual TCE now and the bag houses and fiber beds exhaust streams are now discharged to atmosphere.  Roughly 32,000 ft3/min of air, or half the current SLA capacity is currently used in key areas of the plant to reduce fugitives.  A side effect of this discharge that we expect is extended activated carbon life because historically baghouse dust and PAQ oil smoke have contaminated the carbon.     The project reduced overall plant site Trichloroethylene emissions from 113.3 tons in 2006  to 58.9 tons annually by year end of 2007.  In addition to separating the extraction-(sheet properties setting) & winding sections from the rest of the production operation with walls, we also added  a Trichloroethylene monitoring system in order to monitor potential fugitive zones and take action to minimize zone concentrations through process adjustments.

THIS SUBSTITUTION HAS RESULTED IN A 57% REDUCTION IN WEIGHT PER LINEAR FOOT OF RDC SCRAP GENERATED.   DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD, FROM JANUARY 1, 1999 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002 PSEMC GENERATED 9,525 FT. OR 59 LBS. OF RDC SCRAP.  THE SUBSTITUTION OF TIN FOR LEAD IN THIS INSTANCE RESULTED IN A NET REDUCTION OF 81 LBS.    FROM JANUARY 1, 1995 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002 PSEMC GENERATED 163,393 FT. OR 1019 LBS. OF RDC TIN SCRAP.  THE SUBSTITUTION OF TIN FOR LEAD SINCE INCEPTION RESULTED IN A NET REDUCTION OF 1351 LBS.       SR-2 IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE TIN TUBES BEING SUPPLIED TO PSEMC HAD STAINLESS STEEL IMPURITIES.  THESE IMPURITIES WOULD LITERALLY SURFACE DURING THE PROCESSING OF THE PRODUCT.  THE IMPURITIES WERE DEEMED AS THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE TUBE BREAKAGE PSEMC HAD EXPERIENCED DURING PROCESSING WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL SCRAP GENERATION.    THE SUPPLIER CORRECTED THE PROBLEM AS REQUESTED BY FILTERING OUT THE STAINLESS IMPURITIES FROM THE TIN IN THE MOLTEN STATE WITH A CERAMIC FILTER. ALTHOUGH PSEMC KNOWS THIS WAS AN EFFECTIVE SOURCE REDUCTION, VARIABILITY IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY THE REDUCTION.   SR-3 PSEMC IMPLEMENTED A PROCEDURAL TUBE LOADING MODIFICATION.  THE CHANGE INVOLVED INCREASING THE LOAD TIME BY 15-30 MINUTES PER TUBE.  THIS ENSURES THAT THE UPPER END OF THE TUBE IS LOADED WITH THE PROPER AMOUNT OF POWDER TO MEET AN EXPECTED MASS RATIO OF METAL TO POWDER.     THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE SCRAP AT THE FRONT END OF THE PROCESS.  AS AN EXAMPLE, FROM 1996-1997, PSEMC WAS USING 2,250 FEET PER TUBE AS ITS PRODUCTION AVERAGE YIELD.  AFTER IMPLEMENTING THESE IMPROVEMENTS, PSEMC IS NOW EXPERIENCING AN AVERAGE YIELD OF NEARLY 2,600 FEET PER TUBE. THIS SAVINGS TRANSLATES TO A SCRAP REDUCTION THAT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AS FOLLOWS (1999): (671 TUBES/YEAR)(2,600 FEET/TUBE-2,250 FEET/TUBE) = 234,850 FEET PER YEAR (1,465 LBS)   THE TOTAL SOURCE REDUCTION ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE SR MEASURES SINCE INCEPTION, JANUARY 1, 1998 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS AS FOLLOWS (3303 TUBES/YEAR)(2,600 FEET/TUBE-2,250 FEET/TUBE) = 1,156,050 FEET PER YEAR (7,213 LBS)	NO	CMARTIN@PSEMC.COM			YES

The nuts are now heated to a higher temperature before they are loaded into the sterilization chamber.  The higher temperature causes the nuts to absorb the PPO better and release it more slowly.  After the nuts are removed from the sterilization chambers the PPO continues to off-gas in a post-processing area for several days.  Therefore, while the overall PPO usage in 2007 was less than the PPO usage in 2006, the fugitive emissions (Part II, Section 5.1) increased due to a change in processing method.

The 2006 Form R report showed the total weight of the lead-containing waste shipped to those facilities, rather than just the actual lead content of those wastes.  The solder used at SEL is composed of 37% lead and 63% tin, so the amount of lead shipped offsite in solder dross for recycling should have been reported as 37% of the total weight of the solder dross, not the entire amount.  Similarly, only the actual lead contained in the solder flux and lead-contaminated wipes, rags, and other materials shipped offsite for treatment or disposal should have been reported on the 2006 Form R report.  All Form R reports for lead in the future from SEL will only show the actual lead content in the offsite waste shipments.

The new media now allows the recycle of old billboard media versus the former landfilling of the waste material. Circle Graphics, Inc. has been recognized by award from the trade association.  Circle Graphics, Inc. is proceeding with a program to assess the substitution of UV curable inks for the current N230 based inks. UV curable inks contain no N230 and only minimal amounts of non-TAP VOC. The company has purchased 4 new printers that utilize UV curable inks. These printers are in production; and work continues in assessing further refinements in the inks used to expand the use of UV curable inks.  The capture effeciency of the vent hoods over the printers was increased by modifying the hood design. The increase in capture efficiency resulted in a very high percentage of all fugitive emissions being routed to the RTO, and thus reduced ambient air emissions.
