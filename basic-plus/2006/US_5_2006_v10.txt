Requirements for federal agencies to report Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data began with 1994 data.  A report is required for any listed toxic chemical that is manufactured or processed at a facility in excess of 25,000 pounds during the course of a calender year; or if the quantity of a listed toxic chemical that is otherwise used at a facility exceeds 10,000 pounds during the course of a calendar year.  Entities other than the federal government are required to report if they have a Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 20-39.  Federal agencies must report regardless of SIC code.  Anhydrous Ammonia is included as a toxic chemical on the reportable list.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center as fertilizer for production of corn for livestock feed.  No releases to the environment other than the intended use of anhydrous ammonia occur.  Agricultural use of anhydrous ammonia by non-federal agency consumers would not be required to report.  Soil tests are taken to minimize use of fertilizer to the needs of the intended crop.

These monitors detected the presence of propylene which lead to the discovery of leaking heat exchangers. The units were shut down, the leaking tubes plugged and new exchangers were ordered. During the time it took to install the new exchangers, the monitors estimated the amount of propylene released during calendar year 2006. The increase in propylene released from a point source is due to the addition of these new monitors.	NO	SNOLAN@EPROD.COM			NO

The USEPA identified EAF shops as sources of mercury emissions which can be traced to the scrap metal feedstock that is used to produce steel.  The primary source of mercury contamination in scrap metal is from mercury switches used in automobile hood and trunk convenience lighting.  When these devices are not removed prior to crushing and shredding the scrapped automobiles, the mercury becomes entrained in the scrap and volatilized in the melting process.  Claymont Steel and other EAF recyclers do not want or receive any benefit from mercury in the scrap metal received from suppliers in the region.    Claymont Steel remains committed to reduce mercury emissions from this facility.  To this end, Claymont Steel has implemented a number of source reduction measures to reduce mercury from entering the EAF via the scrap metal feed.  These initial measures are part of an overall Pollution Prevention Program to further reduce the amount of mercury in the EAF feed and to reduce mercury emissions.  Claymont Steel believes this is the most expeditious and environmentally beneficial alternative. The source reduction measures are discussed below:    National Vehicle Mercury Switch Removal Program (NVMSRP).   Claymont Steel joined forces with other members of the Steel Manufacturers Association (SMA) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) to establish the NVMSRP.   Claymont Steel entered into this agreement with other steelmakers to fully fund the NVMSRP over a three year period.    Foster Relationships With Suppliers Who Participate in the NVMSRP.  Claymont Steel will continue to purchase from suppliers who participate in the NVMSRP.  Ultimately, this is the most environmentally beneficial program because the mercury is recovered and recycled in a separate stream rather than allowing the mercury switch to be shredded and volatilized in an EAF at a steelmaking facility.   Claymont Steel has notified suppliers indicating that we intend to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, scrap from vehicles which do not contain mercury from switches or scrap from vehicles that have had mercury switches removed.  The suppliers have been audited to assess their participation in the program and their ability to meet our purchase specifications.    Auto-Free Shred.  Claymont Steel has arranged for our shredded scrap suppliers to supply shred that does not contain automobiles.  Since mercury convenience switches from end-of-life automobiles is the predominant source of mercury in steel scrap, the elimination of this scrap source has already provided an immediate reduction in mercury emissions.  We have audited these suppliers and found that these suppliers have satisfactory procedures in place.  The volume of auto-free shred in the region is limited, so Claymont Steel also purchases shredded scrap from suppliers who have a documented mercury removal program.     No Shred from Municipal Sources.  Claymont Steel has ceased using shredded steel scrap from municipal waste incinerators.  This commercial ferrous scrap is magnetically recovered from residual and commercial waste combustion facilities and there is a concern that there could be residual mercury in this source of scrap in the form of thermostats, manometers, button cell batteries, flame sensors and other mercury-tilt switches.    Revise the Scrap Mix.  Claymont Steel has reduced the amount of shredded scrap charged to the EAF as a percentage of total feedstock.  Other scrap grades not containing auto scrap have been substituted to the extent they are available and feasible.	NO	TOM.WESOLOWSKI@EVRAZINCNA.COM			YES

Reducing the quantity of zinc in our non-hazardous waste will have a significant impact on the environment.  One of the zinc containing product was manufactured with the use of manual controls to open valves, start/stop motors and pumps with no process alarming or logging functionality. Control of vessel temperature and agitator speed was local. Temperature controllers and chart recorders were employed to provide the only automatic control and log functions in the new suite. There were no visual verification of most process parameters nor was there a central location for equipment run or position status.  During the past several years, there had been occasional manufacturing deviations, which had caused production delays and have led to increased non-hazardous zinc waste generation.  This project implemented a programmable logic based control system to automate the batching and cleaning processes within the zinc containing product suite. The new automation system now automatically control system valves, pumps, agitators and load cells incorporating safety/process interlocks while providing the operator with visual indication of all process parameters, equipment status, alarm annunciation and access to historical data for analysis and reporting. In addition, an idle mixing tank has been used to make up a solution used in the batch. This change  allows the incorporation of this ingredient make-up into the batch recipe control, and eliminate one of the preparation and combination phases and has minimized the quantity of batches which have to be discarded as non-hazardous waste.

"Scrap metal" is defined by 40 CFR Part 261.1(a)(6) as bits and pieces of metal parts (e.g.,) bars, turnings, rods, sheets, wire) or metal pieces that may be combined together with bolts or soldering (e.g., radiators, scrap automobiles, railroad box cars), which when worn or superfluous can be recycled.  At the Santa Rosa Lead Products facility, scrap lead is generated in the form of small scrap sheets from cutting processes, lead dust from grinding operations, and excess solder from soldering activities.  This scrap lead is collected and containerized in 55-gallon metal containers and shipped to the Mayco facility in Granite City, Illinois, and/or is collected in "gaylord" crates and shipped to the Mayco facility in Birmingham, Alabama, where it is recycled.  This crated scrap lead is also sold as a commodity to several customers.  In 2006 approximately 199,096 pounds of scrap lead was shipped from the Santa Rosa Lead Products facility.  Approximately 9,365 pounds of this scrap lead was shipped to the Mayco facility in Granite City, Illinois, approximately 61,194 pounds of this scrap lead was shipped to the Mayco facility in Birmingham, Alabama, and approximately 128,537 pounds of this scrap lead was sold as a commodity.

The lead we currently use is by way of our hot-air solder level (HASL), which applies a layer of tin-lead solder to circuit boards.   We also reduced this form of lead usage several years ago through an upgrade in our maintenance staff.  Our former practice was to replace the approximately 800 lbs of 63-37 [63% tin-37% lead] solder in our HASL whenver the copper content reached 0.3%.  This would occur every few months.  Now, we maintain our HASL by drossing the solder periodically.   The knowledge of this process by our current maintenance staff enables us to replenish the solder we use rather than replace the entire 800 lbs, which is a substantial reduction.         Our present solder usage, and therefore our lead usage has probably reached the bare minimum required for our circuit board manufacturing process.	NO	QUALITY@W-TEK.COM			YES

September 6, 2007  Mr. Kenny Harmon Arkansas Department of Emergency Management Attn: Hazardous Material Reporting Building #9501 Camp Joseph T. Robinson North Little Rock, AR 72199   Re:   Georgia-Pacific Wood Products South LLC, Gurdon Plywood and Lumber Complex 2006 Manganese Form R Report Revision   Mr. Harmon,  The Georgia-Pacific Complex located in Gurdon, AR submitted 2006 Calendar Year Form R reports for five compounds prior to the July 1, 2007 deadline. During the course of a routine internal review, we discovered a discrepancy in the Form R report for manganese.  A mistake was made in transferring the calculated releases to the electronic reporting system which resulted in the manganese releases of 60,665 lbs to be over reported as 5,482,860 lbs.  The attached revision accurately reflects the true manganese releases.  A revised electronic submittal is being concurrently submitted to EPA via the CDX electronic reporting system.    G-P appreciates the opportunity to update the manganese report and trusts that the attached report satisfies your needs.
