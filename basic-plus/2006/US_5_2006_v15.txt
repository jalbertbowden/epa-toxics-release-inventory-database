The DCM from a production process that utilizes a large amount of the DCM used during the reporting period is recovered for re-use during the same production batch.  At the completion of the batch production, the DCM is accumulated for shipment to an off-site licensed disposal company for incineration.  Recovery of the DCM during the production batch was instituted in a prior year to reduce the demand for additional DCM to be introduced into the process.  Improvements to the process design were made in a prior year to reduce the potential for spills/leaks.  The DCM recovery process for eventual recycling involves dual collection points that effectively produce a 100% recovery of the solvent introduced into the process.  The DCM recovered at both collection points is re-introduced into the process until the production batch is completed.	NO	RICHARD_TRAMMELL@CERILLIANT.COM			NO

Claymont Steel recycles approximately 500,000 tons per year of scrap steel in an electric arc furnace (EAF).  The USEPA identified EAF shops as sources of mercury emissions which can be traced to the scrap metal feedstock that is used to produce steel.  The primary source of mercury contamination in scrap metal is from mercury switches used in automobile hood and trunk convenience lighting.  When these devices are not removed prior to crushing and shredding the scrapped automobiles, the mercury becomes entrained in the scrap and volatilized in the melting process.  Claymont Steel and other EAF recyclers do not want or receive any benefit from mercury in the scrap metal received from suppliers in the region.    Claymont Steel remains committed to reduce mercury emissions from this facility.  To this end, Claymont Steel has implemented a number of source reduction measures to reduce mercury from entering the EAF via the scrap metal feed.  These initial measures are part of an overall Pollution Prevention Program to further reduce the amount of mercury in the EAF feed and to reduce mercury emissions.  Claymont Steel believes this is the most expeditious and environmentally beneficial alternative. The source reduction measures are discussed below:    National Vehicle Mercury Switch Removal Program (NVMSRP).   Claymont Steel joined forces with other members of the Steel Manufacturers Association (SMA) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) to establish the NVMSRP.   Claymont Steel entered into this agreement with other steelmakers to fully fund the NVMSRP over a three year period.    Foster Relationships With Suppliers Who Participate in the NVMSRP.  Claymont Steel will continue to purchase from suppliers who participate in the NVMSRP.  Ultimately, this is the most environmentally beneficial program because the mercury is recovered and recycled in a separate stream rather than allowing the mercury switch to be shredded and volatilized in an EAF at a steelmaking facility.   Claymont Steel has notified suppliers indicating that we intend to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, scrap from vehicles which do not contain mercury from switches or scrap from vehicles that have had mercury switches removed.  The suppliers have been audited to assess their participation in the program and their ability to meet our purchase specifications.    Auto-Free Shred.  Claymont Steel has arranged for our shredded scrap suppliers to supply shred that does not contain automobiles.  Since mercury convenience switches from end-of-life automobiles is the predominant source of mercury in steel scrap, the elimination of this scrap source has already provided an immediate reduction in mercury emissions.  We have audited these suppliers and found that these suppliers have satisfactory procedures in place.  The volume of auto-free shred in the region is limited, so Claymont Steel also purchases shredded scrap from suppliers who have a documented mercury removal program.     No Shred from Municipal Sources.  Claymont Steel has ceased using shredded steel scrap from municipal waste incinerators.  This commercial ferrous scrap is magnetically recovered from residual and commercial waste combustion facilities and there is a concern that there could be residual mercury in this source of scrap in the form of thermostats, manometers, button cell batteries, flame sensors and other mercury-tilt switches.    Revise the Scrap Mix.  Claymont Steel has reduced the amount of shredded scrap charged to the EAF as a percentage of total feedstock.  Other scrap grades not containing auto scrap have been substituted to the extent they are available and feasible.	NO	TOM.WESOLOWSKI@EVRAZNA.COM			YES

"Scrap metal" is defined by 40 CFR Part 261.1(a)(6) as bits and pieces of metal parts (e.g.,) bars, turnings, rods, sheets, wire) or metal pieces that may be combined together with bolts or soldering (e.g., radiators, scrap automobiles, railroad box cars), which when worn or superfluous can be recycled.  At the Santa Rosa Lead Products facility, scrap lead is generated in the form of small scrap sheets from cutting processes, lead dust from grinding operations, and excess solder from soldering activities.  This scrap lead is collected and containerized in 55-gallon metal containers and shipped to the Mayco facility in Granite City, Illinois, and/or is collected in "gaylord" crates and shipped to the Mayco facility in Birmingham, Alabama, where it is recycled.  This crated scrap lead is also sold as a commodity to several customers.  In 2006 approximately 199,096 pounds of scrap lead was shipped from the Santa Rosa Lead Products facility.  Approximately 9,365 pounds of this scrap lead was shipped to the Mayco facility in Granite City, Illinois, approximately 61,194 pounds of this scrap lead was shipped to the Mayco facility in Birmingham, Alabama, and approximately 128,537 pounds of this scrap lead was sold as a commodity.

These monitors detected the presence of propylene which lead to the discovery of leaking heat exchangers. The units were shut down, the leaking tubes plugged and new exchangers were ordered. During the time it took to install the new exchangers, the monitors estimated the amount of propylene released during calendar year 2006. The increase in propylene released from a point source is due to the addition of these new monitors.	NO	IWZIRBES@EPROD.COM			NO

Small quantities of these raw materials are formulated into various dilute concentration reference standards.  Cerilliant tests outdated materials and re-certifies them for continued use whenever possible.  Consideration is given to recovering and reusing raw materials from formulations that are outdated and can not be re-certified.  In many cases, only enough raw material required to be carried forward in the formulated standard is manufactured, thus minimizing the amount of raw material made.  When manufacturing the raw materials, reaction vessels are configured in a closed system design, which includes traps to eliminate the possibility of air emissions.

Reducing the quantity of zinc in our non-hazardous waste will have a significant impact on the environment.  One of the zinc containing product was manufactured with the use of manual controls to open valves, start/stop motors and pumps with no process alarming or logging functionality. Control of vessel temperature and agitator speed was local. Temperature controllers and chart recorders were employed to provide the only automatic control and log functions in the new suite. There were no visual verification of most process parameters nor was there a central location for equipment run or position status.  During the past several years, there had been occasional manufacturing deviations, which had caused production delays and have led to increased non-hazardous zinc waste generation.  This project implemented a programmable logic based control system to automate the batching and cleaning processes within the zinc containing product suite. The new automation system now automatically control system valves, pumps, agitators and load cells incorporating safety/process interlocks while providing the operator with visual indication of all process parameters, equipment status, alarm annunciation and access to historical data for analysis and reporting. In addition, an idle mixing tank has been used to make up a solution used in the batch. This change  allows the incorporation of this ingredient make-up into the batch recipe control, and eliminate one of the preparation and combination phases and has minimized the quantity of batches which have to be discarded as non-hazardous waste.

The lead we currently use is by way of our hot-air solder level (HASL), which applies a layer of tin-lead solder to circuit boards.   We also reduced this form of lead usage several years ago through an upgrade in our maintenance staff.  Our former practice was to replace the approximately 800 lbs of 63-37 [63% tin-37% lead] solder in our HASL whenver the copper content reached 0.3%.  This would occur every few months.  Now, we maintain our HASL by drossing the solder periodically.   The knowledge of this process by our current maintenance staff enables us to replenish the solder we use rather than replace the entire 800 lbs, which is a substantial reduction.         Our present solder usage, and therefore our lead usage has probably reached the bare minimum required for our circuit board manufacturing process.	NO	TONYFULLERTON@NETVIAGROUP.COM			YES

In late 2005 we worked with our customer to change this process eliminating the polyester resin and gelcoat and going to a paint system utilizing an epoxy primer and polyurethane top coat which contains no haps.  Our styrene emissions stayed relatively close to the usage reported for 2005 however this was due to a radical increase in demand for a different product.  Had we not made the above mentioned changes our styrene emissions would have more than doubled.	NO	PBENNETT@MOLDEDFIBERGLASS.COM			NO

The coolant is filtered, and the filtrant is sent to a recycler.  In those few instances where coolant is not used, we have installed dust collectors that are emptied into a bin and sent to a recycler.

This involved a change in process and by selling used nitric/Hydroflouric etchant to another company for use in their acid etching process.  In 2003, these changes reduced siltronic's discharge of nitrate compounds by 83,000 pounds.  In 2004, the discharge was reduced by another 280,000 pounds and in 2005 siltronic achieved an additional reduction of 105,000 pounds.  In 2006 siltronic showed an increase in nitric compound discharge due to an increase in production and some difficulties with shipping the spent etchant.  However, this number is still substantially less than the amounts discharged prior to 2003.	NO	TOM.FAHEY@SILTRONIC.COM			NO

Disposal of 35,300 pounds of lead in ldr-Compliant waste in RCRA trenches 31 and 34 (Reported in section 8.1a), disposal of 899,000 pounds of lead in ldr-Compliant remediation waste in the cercla erdf trench (Reported in section 8.8), disposal of 0.9 pounds of lead in a treated effluent disposal facility (Permit concentrations were not exceeded, included in section 8.1b), transfer of 27,946.6 pounds to offsite tsd facilities for treatment and/Or disposal (Reported in section 8.1d), and 27,000 pounds of lead sent offsite for reclamation (Reported in section 8.5), all seem to be huge quantities of lead released to the environment.  However, all of this lead was properly disposed of in permitted facilities that were in full compliance with ldr requirements for lead.  The only significant release of lead to the environment that was not into a permitted facility was the 9012 pounds of lead from ammunition fired at the hanford patrol firing range (Reported in section 8.1b).  Although the 899,000 pounds of lead from cercla remediation waste are shown as a "Release to the environment" reported in section 8.8, the actual situation is that this quantity of lead was cleaned up from the environment, and placed into a permanent compliant disposal facility.

Requirements for federal agencies to report Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data began with 1994 data.  A report is required for any listed toxic chemical that is manufactured or processed at a facility in excess of 25,000 pounds during the course of a calender year; or if the quantity of a listed toxic chemical that is otherwise used at a facility exceeds 10,000 pounds during the course of a calendar year.  Entities other than the federal government are required to report if they have a Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 20-39.  Federal agencies must report regardless of SIC code.  Anhydrous Ammonia is included as a toxic chemical on the reportable list.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center as fertilizer for production of corn for livestock feed.  No releases to the environment other than the intended use of anhydrous ammonia occur.  Agricultural use of anhydrous ammonia by non-federal agency consumers would not be required to report.  Soil tests are taken to minimize use of fertilizer to the needs of the intended crop.

In 2005, 1281 pounds of excess lead inventory of was recycled by returning to a vendor.  This was a one-Time movement.  Current use of lead is the use of lead in solder for electronic assembly.  We also use lead free solder products as an initiative to reduce lead in manufacturing.  Our use of lead in solder for 2006 is consistent with the use of lead in solder in 2005 even as our business continues to grow.  We continue to look for ¿Greener alternatives¿ and opportunities as a manufacture but do not expect to see any dramatic changes in the use of lead in solder over the next few years.

The goal of that plan was to reduce certain nutrients, including phophorous and nitrogen.  Although the plan was not specifically targeting a reduction in nitrates, such a reduction appears to have been an added benefit of the plan because the total amount of nitrates discharged in the facility's effluent was reduced by more than 50% in 2006 notwithstanding an approximate ten percent (10%)  increase in the volume of effluent discharged when compared to the prior year (production increased by approximately ten percent in 2006 when compared to 2005).
