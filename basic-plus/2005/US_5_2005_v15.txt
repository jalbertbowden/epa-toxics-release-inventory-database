In 1997, Johnson Controls voluntarily performed emission testing to better define process (stack) air emissions.  This testing was witnessed by the state regulatory agency (MDNR) and used to develop emission factors for air emission reporting.  The test results and calculated emission factors were reviewed and approved by MDNR.  DEOA emissions from foam production are expected to be low, as it is a reactant in the process and is consumed.  This was supported by the results of the emission testing study - all test results were BELOW the analytical detection level (i.e. DEOA emissions were not detected).  Consequently, the emission factor developed for DEOA was based on the analytical detection level.  This is a very conservative approach and results in over reporting of DEOA air emissions.

On 4/8/05, we switched from a bar solder containing 37% lead to one containing 36% lead.  This process, known in wave soldering as a "pot swap" entailed shipment for recycling of all cooled solder contained in two wave solder machines, and shipment of all remaining dross associated with the old solder. This effort therefore accounts for approximately one third of the total amount identified under section 8.5 (offsite recycling for metals recovery).    The RoHS regulations effective date of 7/1/06 also affects Crown's projected numbers in Column C of Section 8 for the next RY, 2006.  As of 5/22/06, Crown ceased lead solder usage in all but a portion of product intended for domestic shipment.  Lead usage in major production operations is expected to cease in Sept. 2006 for all EU intended & domestic product (a small portion of domestic product will continue to contain lead solder after this date).

Likewise, the production of lead selenide and lead sulfide crystals has shown increased yieds, less defects, causing less rework and less lead compound usage.  There are plans to streamline these processes even more in 2006, including changing from using wave solder technology to selective soldering technology.  Large differance in lead compounds listed as fugitive emissions is due to the melting and recasting of solder weights.  This was not done in 2005 and the process has been eliminated for 2006.

PREPA attempted to contact EPA about this and to research their sources but no response was provided.  The n-hexane concentration in the fuel is expected to decrease from the default value to approximately 0.01 weight percent.  An internet and literature search also confirms PREPA's suspicions.  Consequently, releases next year and in subsequent years are expected to diminish by the same order of magnitude.  Applicable Source Reduction Codes are:  W19, W22, W29, W49.

After contact with brook madrone, TRI program manger, (206) 553-4016, she informed us that the hcl liquid in the cylinders was not to be counted only the gaseous form of the hcl.  We then contacted walter preller, boc edwards em gas engineer, (503) 551-9293, which gave us the correct formulas for determining the amount of vapor within the cylinders.  After the calculations were completed it was determined that we have been over reporting the amount of gaseous hcl, for the last few years, because it was really liquid.  Therefore, the number that has been reported as being onsite as well as the number being returned has been reduced to reflect the TRI program agency decision.	NO	TOM.FAHEY@SILTRONIC.COM			NO

To facilitate the continued use of the facility amri has elected to implement an accelerated closure and cleanup program for the braithwaite facility, consistent with the epa's land revitalization action agenda.  The epa's land revitalization action agenda is intended to make land revitalization and reuse an integral part of all federal and state environmental cleanup programs.  To accomplish this goal the epa has established the ready-For-Reuse initiative, and a cooperative partnership with the ldeq to restore inactive properties to productive end use.  Amri completed the braithwaite facility de-Invetorying, residual tank cleanout and facility demolition in 2005 prior to hurricane katrina.  Demolition of storm damaged building and offices that were to remain prior to the storm was completed during the 4th quarter of 2005.  Amri does not intend to report any tri data for the year 2006.

Simultaneously RY2005 shows increases in treatment of methanol.    Release reductions are primarily due to the use of newer, updated and more appropriate emission factors published by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. (NCASI) for the pulp and paper industry.  These emission factors were published in February 2006.  Examples of reduction include air emissions from various equipment sources.  Most of these were reduced.  Furthermore, where NCASI indicated multiple data source tests, the median data was deemed most appropriate.  Previously, some emission factors were based on maximum data points.    The increase in treatment is due primarily due to the percentage of water flow increases when comparing RY2004 to RY2005.  Boise has a relatively unique wastewater treatment system.  The system is an UNOX system that is covered.  Monitoring data has not detected VOC emissions or methanol in the effluent water stream.  Hence the system treatment efficiency is considered nearly 100% effective.  Additional source reductions would not have had significant effects on release reductions.  Newer, updated, and more appropriate emission factors account for the reductions in releases.   RY 2006 will show the effects of methanol reductions due to the HVLC system installed during 2005 to collect off gases from several equipment process points.  It is estimated methanol emissions will be reduced over 90% when the HVLC system is operating and the off-gasses are subsquently incinerated in an industrial furnace.

Release reductions are primarily due to the use of newer, updated and more appropriate emission factors published by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. (NCASI) for the pulp and paper industry.  These emission factors were published in February 2006.  Examples of reduction include air emissions from various equipment sources.  Most of these were reduced.  Furthermore, where NCASI indicated multiple data source tests, the median data was deemed most appropriate.  Previously, some emission factors were based on maximum data points.    RY 2006 will show the effects of acetaldehyde reductions due to the HVLC system installed during 2005 to collect off gases from several equipment process points.  It is estimated methanol emissions will be reduced over 90% when the HVLC system is operating and the off-gasses are subsequently incinerated in an industrial furnace.

The contact agent is David Nagy: Phone 413-452-2000  These zinc compounds (N982) are part of the mixture, which is continuously maintained in proper ratios with other components. This is accomplished by removal of interfering ferric iron using small amounts of nitrite to form insoluble ferrous phosphate sludge.  Heatbath analyses supernatant monthly samples to guide formulation adjustments by adding a replenishing mixture containing zinc phosphate, zinc nitrate, phosphoric and nitric acids to restore the working formulation.   The basic chemistry is as follows: nitric acid oxidizes the steel to chemically bind zinc phosphate to its surface. The bound phosphate acts as an elastic coating having lubricating and rust inhibiting properties, which survive die forming and other abrasive activities.   The resulting ferrous sludge is frequently removed to provide a clean working solution and the sludge is stabilized by adjusting with lime to  pH 6.0+. The stabilized sludge is classified as special waste with verification by TCLP analyses.  Through proper maintenance, the solution is never dumped and the product usage is minimized	NO	MARILYN@BLUFFCITYSTEEL.COM			YES

Initial stages of the reduction program are focusing on identifying all lead containing components/parts and replacing them with equivalent "lead free" materials. Reduction of Lead used in the soldering process and replacement materials are currently being evaluated in various phototype models in preparation for full production.  Actual lead reduction measures will be based upon 2004 baseline amounts, lead reduction in our manufacturing process will be directly proportional to the increase demand by customers to be in compliance with the RoHS standards.

The aqueous ammonia is injected (and thus evaporated) in the exhaust and the majority is immediately consumed in a reaction which converts NOx to nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  Because aqeuous ammonia is evaporated in the SCR process, 100% of the aqeuous ammonia used for this purpose must be reported for TRI.  Usage of aqueous ammonia for SCR is optimized to meet air permit emission limits for both NOx and ammonia slip.    Aqueous ammonia is also used for boiler feedwater pH control.  It was estimated that approximately half of this ammonia evaporates during boiler blow down operations (100% reportable).  Therefore, it was also estimated that the other half remains in the boiler blow down (10% reportable), which is released TOHO Water Authority's reclaimed water pipeline for further use of the reclaimed water.  Although 2006 and 2007 were not reporting years for Cane Island Power Park (because it was not an oil-fired facility during those years), usage of aqueous ammonia was still part of operations, therefore, estimated releases for those years are included in Section 8, Columns C and D of this report.

This caused the captured solids to crystallize on the bottom of the bubbler and could only be removed with aqua regia (Nitric and hydrochloric acid).

The lead compounds are used in certain colors of screenprint ink only and are part of the mixture that is applied to glass products. Painted product is shipped out to customers. Screens containing paint mixtures are cleaned by washing down screens with solvent and the solvent containing lead compound paint residue is transported offsite by an agent, Giant Resource Recovery.  Actual lead compound disposed as 2005 waste was calculated as follows: 8050 total pounds of lead compound based screenprint paint was used in 2005.  (Per the vendor Sara Reportable Report the paint purchased weighed 8050 pounds which contained .4043% lead compound.) The actual lead compound paint weight reported was 3148.22#. The paint was used over 30 set ups. Each set up when complete nets one cup of left over paint residue. The left over paint weighs .22# per cup which contains .4043% lead compound. One gallon of solvent was used  in screen clean up for each of the 30 set ups. 30 gal. of solvent containing lead compound paint residue weighed 423# (30 set ups x 14.1 lbs./gal.= 423 lbs.) If one cup of left over paint weighs .22# and .4043% of the paint is lead compound then that must be cleaned from the screen with one gallon of solvent. (.22# per cup of paint x 30 set ups = 6.6# of paint containing .4043% lead compounds or 2.67# of straight lead compound was transported offsite in 423# of solvent.  This data comes from 2005.

Emission Control Sludge (ECS) is generated from the scrubbing of SO2 with lime (CAOH) slurry, resulting in a gypsum (CASO4) sludge with some metals.  We replaced all the filter bags in our baghouses cell by cell with a new bag design which has three rings throughout the length of the bags.  The rings prevent the bags from collapsing, thereby reducing the chances of clogging and eventually tearring.  This has led to increased baghouse efficiencies and a reduction of lead escaping the baghouses into the scrubbing system and being sent offsite in our ECS wastestream from 338,698 lbs in 2004 to 30,655 lbs. in 2005.
