Therefore, the facility did not reach thresholds for TRI reporting of xylene. Because xylene has been previously reported, and because the amount processed was close to the 25,000 lb limit, we have decided to report xylene even though we are not required to.

Although the generated metal dust volume for 2015 is slightly lower than the corresponding volume for 2014, the actual amount of Cooper is also calculated using the concentrations reported by the analytical laboratory for the metal dust samples collected each individual year. The 2014 measured Cooper concentrations ranged between 1,090 and 2,750 micrograms/kilogram (mg/kg) or parts per million (ppm), whereas the 2015 concentrations ranged between 825 and 4,250 ppm. Consequently, the 2014 and 2015 estimated annual total amounts for Cooper vary significantly, 2,379 and 1,838 lbs, respectively (-22.74%). The reason being is that although the rough metal ingots were the same type, the 2015 volume of generated metal dust was slightly less and  the measured concentrations for 2015 were also a bit lower.

The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank(fermenter) for about 3 days. While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars.During this time yeast cells are added to the fermenter. The yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol andcarbon dioxide gas. Formic acid is a byproduct of fermentation. Some of the formic acid becomes en-trained in the gas stream leaving thefermenter. This gas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied ina carbon dioxide purification plant. The water flow rate on the wet scrubber is controlled to maintain compliance with environmentalregulations and emissions stack testing data.

This trace material is formed as an impurity during processing of hydrogen sulfide to produce sulfur. This would be true of any thermal sulfur recovery operation. It does not appear to exceed the de minimis 1% level in the mixtures formed, and having formed, it is also reacted in the processes to form product sulfur and sulfur dioxide. While the de minimis exemption exempts "mixtures" containing less than 1% of this material from consideration, conflicting guidance suggests that EPA wants impurities in some mixtures reported even if only present at de minimis levels if the mixture is not also deemed to be a product in commerce and "production" thresholds are met. Therefore, we have reported on this de minimis-level impurity because it is believed to be incidentally formed (and then destroyed) in the processes in amounts aggregately exceeding the threshold 25,000 lbs. per year.

These AMD flows are influenced significantly by precipitation and 2015 was a drought year in the region where the mine is located. The AMD flows measured at the location where the AMD exits the mine (mine entrance) were lower in 2015 than 2014. Total load is a factor of flows multiplied concentrations, therefore the total zinc load for the 2015 was much lower than the previous year due to the comparatively low precipitation rates. Additionally, lower precipitation results in lower mobilization of Zn in the mine compounding the reduction in flows by displaying reduced concentrations of Zn in comparison to 2014.

The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank (fermenter)for about 3 days. While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars. During thistime propagated yeast cells are added to the fermenter. The yeast cells consume sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol and carbondioxide gas. Acetaldehyde is a byproduct of fermentation. The acetaldehyde becomes en-trained in the gas stream leaving the fermenter. Thisgas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied in a carbondioxide purification plant.

Although the generated metal dust volume for 2015 is slightly lower than the corresponding volume for 2014, the actual amount of Manganese is calculated using the concentrations reported by the analytical laboratory for the metal dust samples collected each individual year. The 2014 measured Manganese concentrations ranged between 1,900 and 16,350 micrograms/kilogram (mg/kg) or parts per million (ppm), whereas the 2015 concentrations ranged between 1,030 and 23,000 ppm. Consequently, the 2014 and 2015 estimated annual total amounts for Manganese vary significantly, 5,781 and 4,874 lbs, respectively (-15.69%).

The corn slurry is held in a temperature controlled tank(fermenter) for about 3 days. While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the corn starch to sugars.During this time yeast cells are added to the fermenter. The yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethyl alcohol andcarbon dioxide gas. Formaldehyde is a byproduct of fermentation. The formaldehyde become en-trained in the gas stream leaving thefermenter. This gas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied ina carbon dioxide purification plant. The water flow rate on the wet scrubber is controlled to maintain compliance with environmentalregulations and emissions stack testing data. Formaldehyde is produced in an intermediate reaction in the combustion of natural gas. POETPreston has two steam boilers on natural gas, two dryers with one natural gas burner each, and an RTO with three natural gas burners.	NO	CHRIS.HANSON@POET.COM			NO

While the de minimis exemption exempts "mixtures" containing less than 1% of this material from consideration, conflicting guidance suggests that EPA wants impurities in some mixtures reported even if only present at de minimis levels if the mixture is not also deemed to be a product in commerce and "production" thresholds are met.

Although the generated metal dust volume for 2015 is slightly lower than the corresponding volume for 2014, the actual amount of Nickel is also calculated using the concentrations reported by the analytical laboratory for the metal dust samples collected each individual year. The 2014 measured Nickel concentrations ranged between 540 and 6,700 micrograms/kilogram (mg/kg) or parts per million (ppm), whereas the 2015 concentrations ranged between 2,350 and 4,400 ppm. Consequently, the 2014 and 2015 estimated annual total amounts for Nickel vary significantly, 3,456 and 4,247 lbs, respectively (+22.89%). This is despite the fact that the rough metal ingots were the same type; but although the 2015 volume of generated metal dust was slightly less, the measured concentrations for 2015 were in average a bit higher.

This trace material is formed as an impurity during processing of hydrogen sulfide to produce sulfur. This would be true of any thermal sulfur recovery operation. It does not appear to exceed the de minimis 1% level in the mixtures formed, and having formed, it is also reacted in the processes to form product sulfur and sulfur dioxide. While the de minimis exemption exempts "mixtures" containing less than 1% of this material from consideration, conflicting guidance suggests that EPA wants impurities in some mixtures reported even if only present at de minimis levels if the mixture is not also deemed to be a product in commerce and "production" thresholds are met. Therefore, we have reported on this de minimis-level impurity because it is believed to be incidentally formed (and then destroyed) in the processes in amounts aggregately exceeding the threshold 25,000 lbs. per year.

For the first 3-months of 2015, the wastewater samples were analyzed by an external laboratory.  This laboratory also analyzed samples from municipal wastewater treatment facilities.  Because of this, Merck believes that the quality control sample matrices were not representative of our industrial wastewater sample matrices, thus resulting in non-representatively high results.  Therefore, Merck changed to an alternate Virginia Laboratory Accreditation Program (VLAP) approved laboratory, which addressed the interferences associated with the quality control sample matrices.  In Summary, due to a lack of other analytical data, Merck is conservatively including this data is the annual release calculation.	NO	COLLEEN.LANGE@MERCK.COM			NO

While natural gasoline is blended in with the 200-proof ethanol, acorrosion inhibiting fluid is also added. The corrosion inhibitor is added at a ratio of 10 pounds per 42,000 gallons of ethanol. The corrosioninhibitor is manufactured with 20% methanol. The releases of methanol are based on the emissions associated with handling and storing thecorrosion inhibitor. Methanol is produced during the fermentation process of creating ethanol. The corn slurry is held in a temperaturecontrolled tank (fermenter) for about 3 days. While the corn slurry is transferred into the fermenter an enzyme is added to convert the cornstarch to sugars. During this time yeast cells are added to the fermenter. The yeast cells consume the sugars producing equal quantities of ethylalcohol and carbon dioxide gas. Methanol is a byproduct of fermentation. The methanol becomes en-trained in the gas stream leaving thefermenter. This gas stream is channeled through a wet scrubber before being burned in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) or liquefied ina carbon dioxide purification plant. The water flow rate on the wet scrubber is controlled to maintain compliance with environmentalregulations and emissions stack testing data.	NO	CHRIS.HANSON@POET.COM			NO
